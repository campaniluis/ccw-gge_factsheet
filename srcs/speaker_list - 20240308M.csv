UNITED STATES,10:24:02,2024-03-08,0:05:44,"Thank you , Chair and good morning , colleagues . So we did want to , Chair , share some reactions to your proposal from last night , having considered both the proposal and some of the initial reactions that we heard yesterday . I think one reaction that we have is that the proposal as we are understanding it , weapon systems that can select and engage a target without further human intervention , that is how we understand the current state of play . That is a very broad definition . It strikes us as potentially a little bit too broad . And so we think that there are some options for trying to be a bit more precise about what we are discussing and to make a little clearer that we are talking about weapons that include systems that have advanced technologies that are performing certain functions . It is a little opaque in this broad definition . And so a couple of ideas that we have would be to highlight the role of the operator and the fact that there is an activation step . We had the word activation . That is one of the words that we have been discussing . But activation is an important idea because it suggests that there is a system in this and that there is a person who is taking responsibility for engaging with that system . The current formulation is ambiguous on that idea . And so working with your text , one way to do that and sorry , one other thought here before proposing something more specific , the reference to human intervention , I think we have been a little concerned that the word human is overly broad as a reference point in relation to the way that a person would engage with the particular weapon and the particular system . For us , we believe we are talking about weapons that are operated by military operators . And so having a term that is a little bit more precise about the nature of the person that is involved in engaging with the machine we think is important . And so the idea that we had would be to at the end of the clause , the current draft reads without further human intervention . I think our idea would be to delete human there and to just add a simple clause at the end that would read without further intervention by the operator so that that gets at the idea that there is a person that is operating the system and then if you tacked on the words after activation , it would I think capture both of the steps that we think are missing in the current definition and be more suggestive of a weapon whose nature is to include the types of technologies that require activation and involvement by the human operator . So that I think would be our idea there . The other idea that we wanted to revisit was the omission of the word lethal which I know is important for many Delegations and important for us . It is actually in the mandate . We are talking about lethal autonomous weapons . So I think there we would prefer to see after the word "" target "" and so I think there we would prefer to see after the word "" target "" the words "" with lethal force "" just to bring it back in line with the mandate . Thank you , Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
UNITED STATES,10:29:37,2024-03-08,0:00:42,"So it would then become weapons systems that after activation can select and engage a target without lethal with lethal force without further intervention by the operator . So weapons systems that after activation can select and engage a target with lethal force without further intervention by the operator . Is that correct ? Thank you , Chair . Our specific proposal was slightly different . The words "" after activation "" that we had suggested were not placed at the beginning of the clause or of the sentence , rather , but we had suggested putting it at the end so it would read without further intervention by the operator after activation . So it would be at the very end of the sentence and it would put the operator in the activation step closer to the sentence itself . So by the operator after activation . Thank you for that . Yes . I think that is clear . I am looking around for further comments .",Western European and other States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,10:30:35,2024-03-08,0:19:25,"Thank you , Chair . We would also like to share some comments in connection with the issues and comments that you put forward . But before we move on to that , allow me to congratulate all ladies here present on World Women's Day and wish them all every success , good health , and well - being and prosperity . Not just in our efforts to discuss laws , but indeed in general . This is a celebratory day and all of Russia is on holiday , so to speak . But our Delegation will continue to work on lethal autonomous weapon systems . This fact just confirms how interested we are in achieving results and achieving conclusions and recommendations within this group . Moving on to the substantive aspects which you identified , we would like at this stage to focus a moment on topic 1 , so characterizations and definitions regarding what exactly we want to define . In our view , we must talk in light of previous results from the GGE's work and in light of the discussions that we have held , we must talk about weapon systems that are based on emerging technologies in the field of lethal autonomous weapon systems and not merely of lethal autonomous weapon systems . In light of the group's mandate , this is fully justified . We have discussed this on repeated occasions . I see no need to actually repeat those discussions , all the more so because a compromise was reached . Secondly , in light of the understanding or the notion of weapon systems based on emerging technologies in the field of lethal autonomous weapon systems , we clearly need to define what is meant by weapon system . This topic is also nothing new . We have been discussing these questions in parallel fora which focus on weapons control and many Delegations have stated the need to define the notion of a weapon system , especially if we are going to put forward a definition . We believe that weapon systems does not imply an exclusion or limitation and we need to define what exactly falls under that concept . Given that we believe we should be talking not just about weapons with a very high strike potential , but we also need to talk about cybernetic functions , non-kinetic functions and we also need to talk about dual purpose use as these may also have lethal capacities and they also may show autonomy and fall at least in the future , theoretically , they could fall under the concept of weapon systems based on emerging technologies in the field of lethal autonomous weapon systems . This is a very important aspect which warrants discussion within the framework of this group so as to ensure that certain categories of weapons are not placed in brackets . As regards the concept of weapon systems based on emerging technologies in the field of lethal autonomous weapon systems itself , well , we continue to be convinced that under this category which is fairly broad in nature , all fully autonomous and unmanned systems or technical devices fall which are not ammunition and which are designed for the implementation of military tasks without any participation by the operator . We do not agree with the attempts that are being made by certain Delegations to narrow down this category of weapons solely to weapon systems whose only function , whose concrete function would be identification , selection and engagement of a target and those would be autonomous . This is a serious narrowing down and basically it would reduce the definition of lethal autonomous weapon systems to a very small category of weapon systems with a certain degree of autonomy . And weapons systems which could be fully autonomous are placed in brackets as are weapon systems , the functions of which differ from those which were defined as being those of a lethal autonomous weapon system and also as we can see from the comments of the United States , it would also mean that weapon systems that could not be activated by a human would also be placed on the side lines . We have discussed this very seriously . Theoretically that is possible . And many Delegations as far as we understand felt it was very important to not place all those categories on the side lines . That is why we believe that it would not be judicious to keep in the definition once activated . We feel that that is superfluous in light of the further definition of the function of autonomy regarding this weapon system on the basis of emerging technologies in the field of laws . Also Distinguished Chair , we believe that we cannot put forward a definition on weapon systems based on emerging technologies in the fields of laws through the prism of separate functions , critical functions . We have presented our thoughts in quite some detail on this count in 2019 when we presented our approach to how this concept could be defined . We continue to stand by the opinion that defining separate critical functions would lead to us changing the subject matter for discussion within this group and instead of discussing lethal autonomous weapon systems and I emphasize autonomous , we would start discussing systems with different degrees of automation which already exist and which in light of the features and characteristics that they have including regarding the identification selection and engagement of a target could present a significant advantage and offer positive possibilities , opportunities in the context of the implementation of the norms of international humanitarian law . That is why from all perspectives continuing to try and use definitions solely through the prism of identify , select and engage a target would be completely counterproductive in our view . I would like to repeat once again that we are talking about the definitions of an entire category of weapons . We are not discussing possible prohibitions or regulations . We are talking about definitions of a category of weapons which we are discussing . What we do afterwards we will discuss afterwards but when it comes to the definition we need a holistic comprehensive approach because this will really lay the foundations for discussions not just on this topic but also other related issues in the future . So this is a very serious matter as we are laying the ground work for those discussions and for international legal regulation in the long run . Also , Chairman , we believe that the essence of the definition and the essence of these systems , so how they should be characterized is actually found in the 2019 report , in particular in Paragraph 19A . In Paragraph 19A there is a clear definition that is given of what exactly identification , selection and engagement of a target is . In this paragraph it is stated that the role and consequences of the autonomous functions in the field of the identification , selection and engagement of a target are merely one of the main characteristics of a weapon system based on emerging technologies in the field of laws . I would like to underscore one of , so that means it does not all boil down to this characteristic and that was recognized by the group and we believe that it is on the basis of that understanding that we need to build our work . Now it seems to us that we are trying to review or revise this paragraph and say that this is not just one of several characteristics or factors that define a lethal autonomous weapon system but rather is the sole factor that serves to define these weapon systems and that is not appropriate . This was recognized by the group regarding deploy and apply force , above all about apply force . We believe that this is a very broad notion and it applies to many aspects and in the group's previous work we did not focus on the application of force . We believe that we should actually continue along in the same vein or the more so if we are talking about the definition of this category of weapons , in our view , this factor , this characteristic is not determining for this weapon system category . We already said yesterday what is determining and I can list the points I made . There are three categories . What is a weapon system that falls under this concept . What functions they should carry out and how do we ensure the notion of autonomy is clear . Regarding the notion of autonomy , we have also discussed this in detail and set out our views . We continue to abide by the opinion that autonomy is defined by the lack of any intervention by the operator , involvement by the operator . Difficulties surrounding the word involvement is something we are happy to discuss . We would like to draw attention , though , to the fact that regarding human control , a lot of work has been done by the group . We have a series of understandings linked to the concept of human involvement . We can speak about human control . We have the notion of human judgment . We are happy to continue discussing all these terms . On the questions which were raised by you , Distinguished Chair , regarding topic 1 , specifically on the matters at the end of page 3 , a short answer to this question from our side . We do not have one yet . We do not we believe we should not focus on the wording that you have put forward . I have already tried to present the logic behind this , namely why it would be counterproductive to focus on a definition linked to the critical functions that are listed here . We believe that the definition should be broader so as to ensure that all categories of lethal autonomous weapon systems fall under it . We are open to further discussion of the characteristics and definitions . We believe that this is a critically important issue for the work of this group , given that without univocal understanding of what these weapon systems based on emerging technologies in the field of laws are , it would be very difficult to discuss the categories and not versions such as with human control in compliance with international humanitarian law and its applicability to these weapon systems and also the principle of precaution and its use so as to minimize risks . Thank you . Thank you .",Eastern European States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,10:52:04,2024-03-08,0:02:59,I would note that previously the US Delegation stated that we had the suggestion the Chair made was a definition that was too broad . I note that the Russian Federation is of the opinion that it was too narrow .,Eastern European States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,10:55:42,2024-03-08,0:01:01,"I am not using the word work definition , but it might help to see from your side what your remarks in text would lead to . Have you given that already some thinking ? And , of course , you have the floor . Thank you , Chair . We are prepared to very briefly comment and answer your question . We submitted the corresponding text in due time on a possible definition of those kinds of systems . All of those elements that we identified have been included . We think that that remains in force . It remains valid . It corresponds to the subject of the discussion that we have and covers all three categories of factors that we identified . It is our view that they completely are in line with those factors which have been put forward by other Delegations and you , Distinguished Chair , at the start of this definition , we have the weapon system which needs to be defined and what specifically we are talking about , what exactly we understand by weapon systems and then we also go into more detail on that term . Then the second part concerns those functions that this weapons system should carry out . So why they have been designed , what they are designed to do and that concerns a discussion on those critical functions that several Delegations have raised . We see this in much broader terms . We consider that any weapons system which is not ordinance or ammunition which is for military purposes comes under this category if , of course , they are autonomous in nature . Then the third part is an understanding of autonomy , of what exactly autonomous is which for us is the lack of any operator involvement . All three factors are there . That is what we are discussing now . We are prepared to carry on with these discussions but our views on this particular matter is much broader in nature so that we have a very clear definition of this kind of weapon . If we are talking about lethal autonomous weapon systems and we are trying to define exactly that category , then we should endeavor to do this in a comprehensive manner so that there are no categories of weapons which might fall under this understanding are left on the sidelines , are left in brackets . Otherwise , we do not understand how we could define those categories of weapons which have other functions which are different to the critical functions as they have been raised by different Delegations would have a degree of autonomy . What would happen then ? Thank you . I wonder whether we then got it right in the compilation where we now have text lethal autonomous weapon system is a fully autonomous unmanned technical means other than ordinance that is intended for carrying out combat and support missions without any involvement of the operator . That is what we got from your submission , I think . Is that still valid ? Yes , Distinguished Chair . It is indeed still valid . It still represents some interest . It is still valid and moreover , I would draw your attention to the fact that in 2018 we presented a working paper in which we set forth all of our considerations in our approach regarding the definition of weapon systems based on emerging technologies in the sphere of laws that is highly developed as a paper and we would like to ask Delegations to refresh their memories by looking at these understandings , these considerations that we presented at that point in time and to reread this document . It is still highly relevant and topical and it could be useful and taken into consideration by the GGE . Thank you . Thank you very much for reacting and for this truly interactive debate . I am now looking around the room and I see a number of Delegations has already asked for the floor . We have Pakistan , Australia , the United States and Austria .",Eastern European States,Yes
PAKISTAN,10:57:09,2024-03-08,0:07:36,"Thank you , Chair . Good morning , dear colleagues . Chair , we would also like to join others in thanking you and your entire team for presenting us with your remarks and for further engagement on the topics on which we have had some very fruitful discussions . At the very outset , I would like to highlight what you have also noted in your remarks that although this is not negotiation , but it is important that we advance our collective understanding . So we take this exercise for that purpose and we would consider this very useful . You have also highlighted that right now we are not attempting to take certain elements entirely off the table , whether in our discussion on the definitions or under other subsequent topics , but we try to build and advance our work wherever it is possible on which we have had some recent discussions . At this point , I would first like to comment on the question that you have also raised in your remarks on whether it is an autonomy , whether autonomy is a spectrum or absolute before expressing our views on the definitions and characterizations and also briefly react on the views that have been expressed from the floor this morning . Mr. Chair , we believe like many others that autonomy is across the spectrum . The spectrum ranges from fully manual systems where humans make all critical decisions to fully autonomous systems which can select and engage targets without further human intervention . However , when we dissect the term "" autonomous "" in the strictest sense , we encounter a dichotomy that transcends the idea of a spectrum . This means the ability of the system to operate without human input or intervention in the critical loop of decision making , particularly in selecting and engaging targets . In fact , this dichotomy suggests that while we can discuss the degree of autonomy a weapon system possesses reflected in how much it relies on human inputs for its operations , at the point of being labeled autonomous , the system crosses a definitive threshold . Beyond this threshold , a weapon system is capable of executing critical operational decisions such as selecting and engaging targets . This capacity for independent operation without the need for a direct human control in realtime decision making encapsulates the absolute nature of autonomy . In other words , while the development and operational context of weapon system might involve a nuanced spectrum of human machine interaction and collaboration , the classification of system as autonomous is binary . It either possesses the capability to independently carry out critical decision making processes or it does not . This binary distinction also underscores the importance of having a clear understanding on the scope of our work and on the scope of autonomous weapon systems , highlighting the profound implications of crossing the threshold from assisted or semi-autonomous operations or with some sort of automation to full autonomy , which will also inform our work in the regulations . We believe that that threshold is very adequately captured in the language that has come from different proposals and that has been put forward in your remarks as well , which we have discussed in terms of selection and engagement of targets without further human intervention . Second , on the issue of whether we should focus only on critical functions , autonomy in critical functions or other noncritical functions of weapon systems , Mr. Chair , as you have noted , we have heard that some have categorized the definition that you have put forward as perhaps too broad or some as too narrow . We think we are at a very good place right now because we are not prejudging our work that will follow in the discussions on regulations . If during the conversation on regulations or the challenges or the risks , some Delegations raise some risks that relate from autonomy in the noncritical functions of those weapon systems , we will be happily look at those issues and revisit the issue of characterization as well , whether we would want to include those weapon systems in our conversation . However , at this time , we do not believe that a prejudgment or an agreement a definitive agreement on the issue of characterizations or the scope of weapon systems is an absolute requirement for making progress as we go forward on other issues . Another point , Mr. Chair , that you have also included in your remarks is our previous agreements that we have made under this topic . And we have to build , as you have said before , on our previous work . In the 2019 GGE report , para - 19 of the report says , and I quote , on the Agenda Item 5 , characterization of the systems under consideration in order to promote common understanding on concepts and characteristics relevant to the objectives and purposes of the Convention , the group concluded as follows : The role and impacts of autonomous functions in the identification , selection or engagement of target are among the essential characteristics of weapon systems based on emerging technology in the area of laws which is of core interest to the group . The group has already established that these are the essential functions which are of core interest to the group . However , it does not rule out that we cannot consider any other functions as we go forward . Lastly , Mr. Chair , we also take note of the point of view expressed by our Distinguished Colleague from the US on the issue of debate between the United States and the United Nations to the issue of the human intervention or intervention by the operator . We would like to recall I think it was expressed in our earlier discourse as well by the ICRC as well that we would want to keep a broader classification here that does not limit the debate on responsibility and accountability . When we are going to include that discussions on accountability and responsibility , we believe that that will encapsulate a role which would be broader than operator and would include other persons as well which are involved in the decision making process . So we would need to see how we are able to ensure that inclusion as well in our discussion so that we are not ruling that out at this stage . Thank you .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
AUSTRALIA,11:04:58,2024-03-08,0:03:24,"Thank you , Chair . We commend your efforts to bring us closer to a common understanding of the main concepts at hand with a close eye to previous consensus language . We understand that we are focused here on defining the broad category of laws that we are discussing in this forum . Trimming this definition down to its essential characteristics is helpful . The simpler the definition , the better . Chair , we think any definition of laws should focus on the weapons systems themselves rather than the technologies that enable laws . We therefore support your suggestion to delete the reference to technologies such that it reads laws are those weapons systems that we would be comfortable omitting the word identify and focusing the definition on the functions of selecting and engaging targets . We think the phrase once activated is necessary to retain if the definition refers to further human intervention . Without the words once activated , it is unclear what the human intervention would be further to . The words once activated also add clarity about the part of the weapon system life cycle we are talking about . It helps demarcate what functions are performed autonomously after activation and without further human intervention . As an alternative option , we could also accept the formulation proposed by the US today . On your question whether the terms select and engage are cumulative or sequential , we consider them to be cumulative . This is reflected in the word and rather than or . If a system is only capable of selecting a target but not capable of then engaging it without human direction , it would not be an autonomous weapon system . On your question about whether deploy force or apply force is preferable , we understand the terms to have the same meaning in this context but suggest that apply force is clearer to avoid any confusion with the deployment or activation of the weapon system . On the various options listed to refer to human intervention or intervention by an operator , et cetera , we would be happy for this to be simplified to human intervention . However , echoing the point made by the US , we think referring to the operator may add clarity as to which human we are talking about . We welcome your suggestion , Chair , to leave questions 2 and 3 of the topic 1 to be addressed further in the intersessional period and future GGE sessions . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
UNITED STATES,11:08:49,2024-03-08,0:08:49,"Thank you , Chair . Again , just to emphasize we appreciate the quality of the discussion that we are hearing this morning . This is exactly the sort of discussion that we should be having . We are really , really excited that we are having this kind of engagement so early in this process . Chair , thank you very much for your facilitation . I have been listening very carefully to the comments that have been made this morning by colleagues . I am particularly interested in further exploring the Delegation of Pakistan's observations about the binary nature of autonomy . I think when we agreed in this body to characterize autonomy as falling within a spectrum , we were trying to capture a broader idea which is that the type of autonomous features and functions that could be incorporated into a weapon system fall within a fairly broad spectrum . I think that was just a reflection of the emerging nature of many technologies that you have more rudimentary technologies , you have more advanced technologies , you have the types of machine learning and other technologies that are now being very actively focused on , but that when you think about it , the types of autonomous features and functions that could be incorporated theoretically into a weapon system fall within a fairly wide range . But I do agree that there is a binary point and it is this binary point that I wanted to focus on . It is the point at which and I think this is part of the way the Delegation of Pakistan explained the challenge that we are facing . It is the point at which the weapon system ceases to operate with the involvement of the human operator that deployed and activated the system . And so I think we would agree that that point , that moment in time , that point in time is or it can be binary . I think there may be weapon systems that have an ability to continue to engage , but we are focused on those systems that have reached that point that they are no longer operating with the involvement of the operator . And so that is what we are really focusing on and why we had made some of the earlier suggestions that we made . The Russian definition , Chair , that you focused us on , that I now am looking at , I think one of the concerns that we have with this definition and maybe it is just a question for the Russian Federation to help us understand how they see this binary moment , if the Pakistani Delegation and the US Delegation are understanding it in the same way , where is that moment in their definition ? It is a bit unclear to our Delegation and this really gets at the point that the Delegation of Australia just made about sort of where are we in the life cycle ? So this is ambiguous on that question . It appears to posit that there is a weapon system that is out there . It is unclear how the weapon system got out there , who put the weapon system out there , how it was deployed , when it was activated . It is just out there . And that the definition would then capture that weapon system only if it operated without any involvement . So what we see is missing from the definition is where the person , the engagement of the operator , the engagement of the human being is taking place . I think the definition that you have been guiding us through is clear on that point . The idea is that it is the operator that has decided to use the weapon , has decided to use it in a particular context , has activated the system that is being used and that at that moment in time it is , as the Pakistani said , it is past that binary moment . It is now out there and it will perform a function , a lethal function without further intervention by that operator . So that is I think one of the key questions that we have with the Russian definition as you read it out . I think the other question that we have about the Russian definition is the exclusion of ordinance . There is a very clear carve out , technical means other than ordinance . That is unclear to our Delegation and we would appreciate understanding that a little bit more . Does that mean that any weapon that explodes even if it included autonomous features and functions would be excluded from the definition ? That is the type of question that we had . And then the reference to combat and support missions . I think this gets a little bit to the question of whether or not we want to focus on the essential characteristics of weapon systems . I think in our view having a very broad and general reference to combat and support which is not easily understandable for us is a little bit at odds then with the view that we should not be further precise about the essential characteristics that we are talking about when we are talking about combat missions or combat and support missions . We read the 2019 GGE report language a little differently , I think , than the Delegation of the Russian Federation . We agree that when it refers to identification selection and engagement of targets as being among the essential characteristics , that is clearly a formulation that suggests that there may be other essential characteristics . So I think we would agree with the Russian Federation in the way that they are reading that particular phrase . But the premise of the 2019 report language was to reflect a degree of consensus that it was important to understand what those essential characteristics were . In particular , to make sure that we were being precise about the types of functions that would be most relevant to the type of weapon system that we are now discussing . So while I think we are sympathetic to the idea that there may be other characteristics , I think we this seems to us to be a binary moment . If we are going to try to be precise , and if there are other characteristics beyond identification selection and engagement , we should work to try to identify what those are rather than say let's delete them altogether and leave ambiguous the types of features and functions that we are talking about . So again , this is all being raised in the spirit of promoting an interactive discussion . We are genuinely interested in engaging in some of these finer points . But these are the types of questions that we wanted to raise . And again , like the Delegation of Australia , I think we are really focused , Chair , on the language that you suggested overnight . And it does seem like this is the right language to focus on with hopefully limited adjustments . But to the extent that there are important issues that we need to address with precision , of course , we should entertain further adjustments . Thank you , Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
AUSTRIA,11:17:59,2024-03-08,0:06:43,"Thank you very much . And we also note that we are getting in depth in this discussion which in itself is a good thing . And just share some of our remarks on the discussion and also on your document from last night and your suggestion . First of all , I think something that is important to recall and something that has been put as a question by the Indian Ambassador on Monday and something that also the Russian Federation has now reconfirmed is that in the end the definition that we are having here will be different from what will be the regulation and prohibition . So I think that is very clear to us and I think that is kind of a working assumption that we are having here as well . The definition serves for us to know what we are talking about . But in the end , it could differ significantly on the prohibitions and regulations part where we definitely need more detail and clarity . When it comes here to this part , I think our criteria would be rather it to be simple and broad so that it encompasses all kind of technological developments that we cannot foresee , that it is something that not by accident excludes things that we actually all want to have included . For that purpose , we always thought that original proposal by the ICRC has been very useful and I think many Delegations in this room has taken this definition more or less as their working assumption and we note that your proposal from last night is very , very close to that . So this just confirms that after the discussions this week , that we kind of end up in this direction , that this has always been kind of the right way . Another thing that is also important for us , that if we go in a let's say wider discussion on the definition that strays a little bit away , is that it also stays functional , that it kind of keeps the notion in there that a weapon system is not a weapon system itself , but that it can be included in all kind of other types of weapons technology , in all kind of vehicles , machines and other parts that we will find on the battlefield . So this definitely should also be one of the key criteria when we talk about the definition . Coming to the discussion that we had about binary approaches and also kind of the functional approach , there is one problem that we also see is that it should be also clear that this is not a weapon system in itself , but an ability . The problem that could appear in the future is then when we go into the regulations part and we exclude we specifically talk only about weapon systems that function autonomously , we might exclude weapon systems and this is simply a practical reality and probably the most common way of using autonomy in weapon system is that it is something that probably can be switched on and off . I assume that most , and this is just an assumption , we cannot predict the future , but we assume that most weapon systems will be able to be used with full control , but also autonomously . Once again , there is this idea of this as being a spectrum , it can be a spectrum on the whole kind of technology phase , but it can also be a spectrum in the way a weapon system is used . So this means if you have systems that can be used even within the same operation in an autonomous mode and in a non-autonomous mode at the same time . This creates some problems with the regulation part . So if we are having a very narrow definition that excludes this other ability , so if it is not functional , one system might be on the same day an autonomous weapon system and a non-autonomous weapon system . So just to have this a little bit in mind , this is the big , big problem with having a non-functional approach . Then in general , I mean , we already have expressed our preference for the simple formulation that you have proposed and that we know quite well , but in general , the three parts , so what are we talking about ? What function does it propose ? And then how do we define the notion of autonomy ? I mean , this is definitely the main questions that we resolve around and here we agree with the Russian Federation . Just two last remarks on the proposal on the table . I think we would have a strong reservation on the lethal when it comes to the US proposal about apply lethal force and this just is reinforced by the many arguments that have been on the table already with having lethal already in the title . I think when it comes to this formulation , these arguments are even more pertinent than they are in a mere title . We , as I mentioned before , have a strong preference for the human intervention . Here we concur completely with Pakistan when it comes to the operator question that if we focus too much in the definition part on the operator , we exclude a little bit the state side and the big questions that we still have to discuss with regard to accountability and responsibility and the word any is simply also too absolute for us . It creates many problems in this direction and we prefer , as I mentioned before , the human intervention but have problems particularly with those two words , with the words any and with referring only to an operator . Yes , I leave it with that . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
REPUBLIC OF KOREA,11:25:06,2024-03-08,0:02:56,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . I thank the Chair , Chair's team and the Secretariat for your able leadership in trying to guide us forward and the another very useful , intriguing and complicated discussion we are having this morning and considering the discussions that is ongoing this morning , we are of the view that we would definitely need to do some more ironing , iron out some fundamental differences when it comes to characterization in order to move forward on other more aspects focused on measures , specific measures . Since others have mentioned , I would simply repeat that the notion of lethal is an essential component when we come to characterization in light of the mandate we are working under . So while we support your approach of having a broad characterization , we would also need to be at least specific enough to include all essential elements . And on the Distinguished Russian Federation's remarks that the current formulation proposed by you , Mr. Chair , is serious narrow down . We are puzzled by this remark at this moment . As far as we understand from the Russian Federation's paper and its remarks , Russian Delegation is proposing to only limit our discussions to fully autonomous systems . But in fact , the formulation proposed by the Chair and many other Delegations throughout this week , we only laid out select and engage , but it was not an exclusive concept , but rather we the ROK is of view that these two concepts of select and engage is a critical component when we discuss about laws . So we would not mind putting inserting words like inter alia before select and engage if that is helpful to make it broad enough . But as we are talking about lethal autonomous weapons systems , we are of the view that autonomy will have to at least be covering the lethality aspect of the system . In other words , the autonomy will have to touch upon most direct aspects when it comes to weapons systems . So we cannot exclude at least the word select and engage when we come to this . To summarize and to clarify myself , I think the Russian Federation's suggestions is actually narrower than what they mean to say . I do not know if this is an issue with the translation , but that is how we understand and how we are puzzled by it . Thank you .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
FRANCE,11:28:14,2024-03-08,0:04:37,"Next is France . You have the floor , Madam . Thank you , Chair . Thank you for having circulated your questions last night . That gave us time to look at it with our experts and provide a detailed response about the various points and suggestions you have made . Regarding characterizations and definitions , first of all , we would like to support your endeavor , which would be to establish a broad characterization of the systems that we are talking about in the context of our discussions . Our understanding is that this exercise does not seek to come up with a final , definite , validated definition . Rather , it would allow us to define categories of the weapons which we must either prohibit or regulate , as is the case under all of the CCW's protocols . This categorization exercise is , therefore , more a way of setting out the perimeter for our discussion . We would like to provide some elements of response to the various issues you raised . In the working paper that France submitted , along with Germany , Bulgaria , Denmark , Italy , Luxembourg and Norway , we identified that the lethal autonomous weapon systems , and I will say it in English , that are once activated able to identify , select , track and apply force to targets without further human intervention . We believe that the concept of "" once activated "" is critical because it makes it possible to draw a distinction between the phase where you have got initial or nominal human control and then the deployment stage of the system . It highlights the decisive stage when the chain of command validates the command given to the machine and delegates a certain degree of autonomy to it , a degree which is adapted to the context and to the mission that it must carry out . After having listened to the views of delegations earlier on this week , it appears that the term "" track "" could be discarded in order to give priority to identify , select and engage as critical functions that the system can do autonomously . This is the wording that appears in the report of the GGE of 2019 , paragraph 19A . We would also prefer to speak of human intervention rather than intervention by the human operators because to our mind , the term "" human intervention "" is more broad and allows for the totality of the chain of command control to be included , not restricting it merely to the weapon operator . Chairman , more broadly speaking and in order to pick up on our latest comment , we believe that autonomy could be understood as a continuum . As we have already said this week , it would be premature to try and approve a common definition at this stage given the exploratory nature of our discussions and technological developments . We also believe that the definition should be intrinsically linked to the notion of human control . We consider that fully autonomous weapon systems are systems that can modify their initial action domain , their mission or their framework of use without humans validating this change . However , autonomy can also apply to certain functions of the system without that making the system a fully autonomous entity that would set its own rules . This would be partial autonomy that is subjected to human control which subordinates the work of the system to a clear framework that is defined by the human themselves . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
GERMANY,11:33:01,2024-03-08,0:02:51,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . Thank you for giving us the possibility to come back on important issues we discussed at the beginning of the week as well as for your well thought through remarks that were circulated last night . We find the way in which you have structured our discussions in the course of this week highly useful and we very much appreciate the efforts of you and your team in this regard . As for your suggestions on revisiting topic 1 , characterizations and definitions , we would have seen some merit in the use of the wording technologies that enable laws in order to avoid a discussion of certain systems that may at one point in time be outpaced by technology . But we note that numerous Delegations prefer to use a more narrow wording as you stated in your comments and we are ready to be flexible in this regard . Our Delegation would prefer to keep the notion once activated or after activation as the colleagues from the US proposed for the following reasons . In our view any system that is not fully autonomous but features autonomy in certain functions will be put into a state of operation by an action . We therefore see the activation part as one of the relevant aspects of an emerging technology in the area of laws and crucial in its own right as it represents the point in time after which a system will fulfill the task it was specifically designed for . We align ourselves with the remarks just made by France in this regard and we also support the wording without further human intervention . We would see some merit in sticking to agreed language and keep identification keep the identification part as one of the essential characteristics of laws , identify , select and engage . In our view the identification forms an important part of the critical functions that may be undertaken by a weapon system featuring autonomy in various functions including because it may be relevant with regard to the challenges related to underlying unintended biases . On the question whether to deploy or apply force we consider apply force or apply lethal force as the colleagues from the US proposed to be better descriptive of the effect that the weapon systems under discussion could achieve through their actions as was outlined by the distinguished colleague from Australia . Our Delegation agrees with your suggestion to discuss some more fundamental questions during the intercessional period or at the following GGE session . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
MEXICO,11:36:09,2024-03-08,0:07:50,"Thank you very much , Chair . I would like to join all those who have spoken before me and commend you on the way in which you are conducting our work . I believe that it had been several years since the GGE had been dedicated in this way from the very start of the week to tackling substantive matters in a clear and orderly way . So my congratulations to you . I would like to say that the level of discussion has been excellent . We view this as an ongoing process which requires Delegations to reflect and take home all the considerations to feed into our future debates . So we understand that we are still in a process of thought and reflection . And we are not going to be adopting specific texts such as a definition . In terms of some initial recommendations I could make , well , first of all , on Tuesday my Delegation voiced a certain skepticism about the notion of once activated . We thought it could be a possibility , but I see that it has given rise to a lot of discussion . For Mexico , as we have said within this Working Group , autonomy implies the incorporation of emerging technologies in the compilation processing of functions that are on the margin of human intervention . And that autonomy is what links this topic to those technologies . We do welcome the definition by the United States , though , and Germany for those Delegations , activation is what establishes that clear indispensable link with the systems technology . And that is something that we will take into account as we prepare for our future discussions . I think that the discussion about the term once activated has opened up other topics for discussion , for instance , whether that activation must be done by a human or whether it could be automatic activation or autonomous activation as the Russian Federation was pointing towards . For Mexico , this characteristic would be determined depending on the viability of human involvement at the time of engagement . I am afraid I can not find the Spanish term , so I am going to say the English one , engagement and the use of force . Still regarding the term once activated , Mexico believes we should consider autonomous weapons in the full spectrum . So the term once activated could be a practical consideration of the weapons operation , but it does not exclude the measures that this group of experts will have to consider , especially as regards the design , development , legal assessment in accordance with Article 36 , its deployment and its use . This is in keeping with what Costa Rica said during the general debate when they spoke on behalf of the G15 . With regard to critical functions and what they should be , Mexico believes that the process through which autonomous weapons systems select targets , engage targets and apply force against them without human intervention is essential . For us , human intervention must be meaningful in order for the process to be compliant with international humanitarian law . Therefore , we agree with Pakistan that we need clarity about the fact that in the weapons full spectrum there must be a meaningful human decision at the level of critical functions . We also agree with what the ICRC said according to which it would be better to use the term user rather than operator . The category of operator can be a very broad one and there are other proposals that identified the relevance , for instance , of command and control . And I would like to refer to the document that was prepared for this session by Germany , Bulgaria , Denmark , France , Italy , Luxembourg and Norway in that respect . These are issues which we believe require further work . We also agree with Austria that we could limit or rather it would not be appropriate to restrict ourselves to operator when we discuss accountability either . Another point , my Delegation is fully aware that the term lethal is included in the name of this group of experts . However , we believe that after ten years of discussions several Delegations feel that the term lethal is not a useful category as we strive to produce an outcome for our work . On the contrary , it could actually be confusing . Also from Mexico's perspective we understand that within a complex number of functions the critical functions are identification selection and engagement of a target . We would like to reiterate that from Mexico's perspective identification for us is implicit in the act of selecting a target . My Delegation , though , cannot agree with the idea of going into an exercise that would identify all the functions that would be required for a definition because this would lead to unnecessary complexity within our group's work . Nor does our Delegation agree or believe and Pakistan said this as well , that we do not believe that finding a definition is a sine qua non-condition for broaching the other topics that are relevant to our discussions . In fact , we believe that deepening of understandings on other points could actually help us refine and fine - tune a potential definition if this definition is to be reached by consensus and that , of course , is necessary for a future instrument . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
CHINA,11:44:12,2024-03-08,0:06:33,"Thank you , Chair . The definition and characterization of laws is very important indeed . This is the foundation and provides the preconditions for any measures that are to be adopted in the future . Throughout this week , we have held discussions on this and on the basis of the documents submitted by the Chair . These in - depth discussions have allowed us to gain a better understanding and this has inspired our considerations on this issue . Given that lethal autonomous weapons systems are very complex , we can see that there is a great divergence of views as to the understanding of this term . Firstly , we wish to make some comments on the definition and the characteristics . We believe we need to adopt a serious attitude here and to adopt precaution . We should undertake broad discussions , in - depth discussions and we must not exclude weapons systems that should be included . We must also make sure that we do not include weapons systems that should be excluded . For example , some Delegations have already said that from the law's scope we should exclude automatic and remote weapons systems . Chair , I shall continue in English . As I said , the discussion on the definition and characteristics should be conducted in a prudent and serious manner . And just like if we rush out a definition such as , for example , a working definition or a vague understanding but without making clear what this definition will be used for , we may have to go back and repeatedly discuss this issue when we discuss specific measures in the future . So we should avoid this situation . And our Delegations suggest that we first clarify what is the purpose of our discussion on the definition . So I notice that some Delegations are discussing the definition of laws that should be linked to both prohibition and regulation measures in the future , while other Delegations believe that this definition is to be included in the future international legally binding instrument which will focus on prohibition . In these two cases , the scope of weapons systems to be covered is quite different . So our Delegations suggest that we can clarify the scope of application or the objective of the definition under discussion . For example , we can add the following statement at the beginning of the text , like without predicting any measure options , the definition and characteristics of laws are as follows , or laws that should be prohibited should have the following characteristics . And we welcome other suggestions on this statement . Our Delegation believes that laws that should be banned should have the following characteristics . Firstly , lethality , meaning sufficient lethal payload and means . Secondly , full autonomy . Thirdly , impossibility for termination . Fourthly , indiscriminate killing capabilities . And fifthly , evolution capabilities , meaning that the weapon system can learn and self - update autonomously , expand its functions and capabilities in a degree exceeding human expectations . We think that autonomous weapon systems with all of the five characteristics clearly have anti-human characteristics and significant humanitarian risk . The international community should consider working to reach a legally binding instrument to prohibit such weapon systems . In addition , considering that technologies related to laws are still in rapid development , when discussing the definition , we should take into account the future technological development . Our Delegation suggests that we could add the following statement at the end of the text , that the above description does not affect high contracting parties' future understanding and improvement of the definition when formulating the international instrument . I would like to emphasize that there are multiple ways and perspectives to give a definition . Some Delegations define laws from the perspective of kill chain , while others suggest to do it from the perspective of functions or operational effects . Our Delegation is open to different options , but we believe that we should clarify that laws does not include automatic weapons or remote control weapons in order to scientifically and accurately define laws and to promote substance progress in the GGE process . Thank you , Chair .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
BRAZIL,11:51:05,2024-03-08,0:04:19,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . I would like to begin by joining others who have thanked you for the preparation of this proposal on the issue of the characterizations and definitions . It is our perception that your proposal is quite elegant . It is very concise and precise and these are virtues that any legal definition should aspire to have . Even though we are not at this point yet drafting a legal Treaty , this is definitely the direction we believe that we should be going towards . Among its many qualities in our view , it is the fact that it would , if we adopted as a working definition , take us out of the tautological formulation that we have been employing thus far . Weapon systems based on emerging technologies in the field of lethal autonomous weapon systems is absolutely circular and tautological and I believe adds absolutely no clarity to our discussions and even brings to the four aspects that I believe that many Delegations have indicated should not be the primary concern of our group , namely the technologies underpinning those weapon systems . I would like also to offer some reactions to many interesting points raised by other Delegations , in particular the observations made by my distinguished Russian colleague . I believe I understand that the Russian Delegation qualified your proposal as being too restrictive and instead proposed a definition that would only encompass weapon systems that are capable of functioning without any involvement of the operator . From our perspective , the perspective of our Delegation , this alternative definition would actually be extremely restrictive , restrictive to the point in which it is hard to think of any real world weapon system currently existing or in development that would fit it . And crucially , it would leave out of the definition and by extension of our substantive deliberations regarding these weapons systems that are endowed with very high degrees of autonomy . As many Delegations recalled , best consensus agreements reached in the context of the GGE , namely the 2019 report , already recognized the identification , selection and engagement of targets as essential characteristics of laws . I would also like to agree , to express our agreement with my distinguished colleague from Pakistan in his very eloquent intervention . Autonomy does have , it exists on a spectrum , but it does have a clear threshold and this threshold is crossed precisely in these critical elements of selection and engagement of targets . That is what inherently creates challenges for the application of IHL . Not unsurmountable necessarily in all cases , but it does create the challenges . And that is not to say , however , that all weapon systems that are , that have autonomy in those critical functions should be prohibited . That would , of course , depend on an assessment of other critical elements such as the degree of human control and the characteristics of its use . Some such systems have been operating for many years and I have already mentioned this week the example of closed - in weapon systems that are endowed with a high degree of autonomy and do not generate a very high degree of concern in terms of compliance with IHL . I would also like to concur with Austria and his remarks , my distinguished colleague from Austria and his remarks about the , and also Mexico , about his , the issue of lethality . It is a term that in our view , even though it is in our mandate for many years , adds no clarity to our discussion . It is not defined by IHL and I would also point out that none of the five CCW protocols even mention the word . So it is our belief that continuation of its use can only lead to confusion and lack of precision which as I began my intervention is the opposite of what we should be striving for . Thank you very much , Chair .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
ICRC,11:55:41,2024-03-08,0:04:58,"Now the floor to the Distinguished Representative of the ICRC . Madam , you have the floor . Thank you very much , Chair . And thank you for circulating your helpful material last night including the text proposal for characterization which we note maps closely to ICRC's long held understanding of autonomous weapon systems as weapon systems that select and apply force to targets without human intervention . We agree with the Distinguished Representative from Australia that the terms select and apply force or engage are cumulative . We think it is appropriate that this text focuses on the key characteristics that mean that with autonomous weapon systems , humans do not choose the specific target that triggers a strike . This is what makes autonomous weapons distinct from non-autonomous systems where a human selects the specific target and the precise time or place of a strike . For the ICRC , it is this process by which autonomous weapon systems use force that raises core concerns . It is also important for us that any characterization remain technology neutral in the way of your proposed drafting in order to future proof regulations and ensure they remain relevant and effective . Considering the addition proposed this morning by the Distinguished Representatives from the US and from France referring to activation , we think this could be a useful clarifier , though we do note the points that were well made just now by the Distinguished Representative from Mexico and flagged earlier by the Russian Federation as well on the need to perhaps clarify this , for example , whether this is human or automated activation . On the inclusion of the qualifier of lethality , I will refer back to our intervention earlier in the week and in previous sessions and we echo the comments made just now by Brazil that this term does not find justification in IHL . To add to those interventions , we consider that lethality is not an inherent property of a weapon system . Whether a weapon's use results in death or other injury is always a combined function of the specific weapon , its use in a specific context and the vulnerability of those affected by it . Use of weapons described as nonlethal can also result in fatalities and permanent injuries . If we understand the reference to lethal not as an expression of deadly consequences resulting from the use of autonomous weapons but rather as a way to differentiate between offensive and defensive autonomous weapon systems or uses , then differential regulation of autonomous weapons as to whether they are intended to or actually used in defensive or offensive capabilities also finds no justification in IHL . The rules that govern the conduct of hostilities apply to acts of violence whether in offense or in defense and that text is found in Article 49 of additional protocol 1 . Ultimately , Chair , it seems to us that not all Delegations understand the reference to lethality or lethal force in the same way . So we are concerned that the inclusion would prove problematic when seeking a common baseline and we would again recommend omitting any reference to lethal from a characterization to ensure that the work of this GGE is not unduly narrowed and also to avoid differing interpretations . Chair , we support the reference in your draft to human intervention . We may have some concerns replacing this with the term operator . As a practical matter , it may be difficult to identify a single operator given that the operation of many systems are likely to involve many different individuals . We do note the concern well made by the Distinguished Representative from the US to bring more precision to the definition and we wonder if to address this and as proposed by Mexico , Pakistan and others this morning , it might be more appropriate to amend the term to refer to intervention by a human user . Our interpretation would be that this would cover not only operators but all commanders and others responsible for planning , deciding upon or executing attacks who hold obligations under IHL . Ultimately we would also recommend retaining the qualifying term human as again we consider this goes to the core of what sets an autonomous weapon system apart from non-autonomous weapon system . The fact that a human is removed from the process of selecting and applying force to targets . Thank you , Chair .",Non-applicable,No
NEW ZEALAND,12:00:54,2024-03-08,0:03:57,"Thank you , Chair . Including for the disciplined and engaging way that you have chaired our work this week . Thanks also to our colleagues for the stimulating discussions this week . As my Delegation made clear on the first day of our deliberations , we recognize the restrictive definitions or characterizations could inadvertently exclude future technological developments from our work . At that time we called for a flexible and technology neutral approach . We make that call again now . It is not impossible to imagine a situation where technological advancements extend beyond the collective imagination of us here in the CCW . But we also have questions about the approach of tackling the question of definitions early from a process perspective . For many Delegations , the driving concern is how existing IHL applies to new weapon systems with degrees of autonomy and possibly where new IHL should be developed . Including to ensure that there is sufficient human control or oversight throughout the life cycle of new weapon systems with increasing degrees of autonomy . Below the threshold of fully autonomous systems , there is a spectrum of weapon systems that have varying opportunities for human control over or involvement in targeting and engagement decisions . This is not the subjective view of New Zealand but a technological fact . As many in this room know , New Zealand has theoretical and practical questions about the absence of humans from critical decision making steps in the selection and engagement of targets . These questions are driven by legal , ethical , humanitarian and international stability concerns . Unpredictable systems may spark or worsen conflicts . Unexplainable systems are theoretically incapable of operating in compliance with IHL . It is the view of our Delegation that instead of focusing on defining and characterizing , a more constructive approach would be to investigate human control more closely . That is , the necessary elements of human control that must be present in the operation of a weapon system with varying degrees of autonomy in order to guarantee their legal , ethical and safe operation . We would replace consideration of definitions with such a discussion . Chair , we have also we also have questions around whether a technical and technology restrictive definition is necessary and not just an exercise in perhaps limiting the scope and effectiveness of any future instrument . As many in this room are well aware , there is no internationally recognized definition of a nuclear weapon , yet almost all of our Delegations continue to work to control and restrict the spread of nuclear weapons . At the very least , the negotiation over what is and what is not an autonomous weapon system is very likely to be one of the most challenging issues in our deliberations . It may only click into place in the final stages of the negotiation on a new instrument , when we know what kind of controls , rules and limits we are talking about . We can also imagine a situation where different definitions may be required along the spectrum of autonomy and depending on what legal rule or positive obligation we are talking about . Finally , Chair , a working definition or list of possible characteristics could aid our work , but it is the strong view of our Delegation that we need to tread with care in engaging in legalistic discussions around definitions and characterizations so we do not unduly and prematurely limit the scope of this GGE . I thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
INDIA,12:05:05,2024-03-08,0:02:35,"Thank you , Mr. President . Thank you for your guiding questions which have been the basis of very good discussions on defining and characterizing laws . My Delegation has always stressed the importance of such discussions on definitions and characterizations and has benefited enormously from the contributions of the many Distinguished Delegations . We believe that the Delegation of China has raised a very important question about the objective of the definitions that we are discussing . If I have understood the intervention of the Distinguished Colleague from China , and I agree with that if I have understood it correctly , it is that is this definition that we are discussing now specific to an instrument that we could possibly develop or is it the equivalent of a global standard on laws or autonomous weapons that we are discussing ? I also would like to request through you , Mr. President , the attention of the Russian Delegation to two questions that we have . The first is that if autonomy is a spectrum , then do laws occupy the far end of that spectrum ? We understand that there is a common understanding in the previous documents of this GG that autonomy exists as a spectrum . In that case , do laws as the Russian Delegation understands it occupy the far end ? Related to that is the question of our automated systems or highly automated systems also situated along the spectrum as we understand it . In other words , could there be some overlap between automated systems with what other Delegations are describing as partially autonomous weapons systems ? Another question that I have for the Russian Delegation is in relation to the reference to dual use systems . We would greatly appreciate some more clarity on what this entails with some practical examples . Thank you very much , Mr. President .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
CUBA,12:08:21,2024-03-08,0:02:21,"Thank you , Chair . We would like to thank you and your team for your work done with the support of the Secretariat . Our Delegation also understands that this exercise is an initial approximation in our work and that a lot remains to be done before we actually reach a final definition or text . Nonetheless , the approximation that you have given is a step in the right direction . Our Delegation in the context of characterization shares the view that points to the fact that there is a threshold which sets apart certain weapons systems which we tend to call semi-autonomous and then fully autonomous systems . In this distinction you find the critical functions and the retention of meaningful human control . On this particular point our Delegation maintains that the functions of selecting and engaging a target are those that will determine future characterization . We are looking at the element of activation and its place here . Regarding the question about whether it would be better to use apply or deployment of force , we are in favor of the word apply . We do not believe it is necessary to characterize the use of force as lethal or nonlethal , though . Like other Delegations , we prefer the term human intervention . This not only allows us to maintain the necessary flexibility for ensuring responsibility and accountability , but also it strengthens the notion of human control from the very outset of the characterization exercise . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
LUXEMBOURG,12:11:03,2024-03-08,0:02:18,"But first , Luxembourg . Thank you , Chair . Also let me quickly echo other Delegations in thanking you and your team as well as the Secretariat for the way you are guiding our work this week . We understand the need and wish of Delegations to have a working definition or characterization to scope of our discussions here in the GGE , even though without the definition being final . We are also in favor of an inclusive approach to characterizing and defining laws which would be leaving the necessary space to include emerging technologies and evolving technologies and to formulate pertinent regulations . Concerning the concrete questions you put in front of us , as other Delegations said , the term was activated . We could agree that it would be a useful or could be a useful qualifier . Then we would like to see the incremental approach and continuity of identify , select and engage , retain , especially since identification is in our view an important element of laws . Also in relation to the potential bias , it could include as our colleagues from the German Delegation put out furthermore , we also would prefer the term human intervention as it is broader and reflects better the chain of command and control of the system . On deploying force or applying force , we were the ones that in our national submission used or submitted the term deploying force where we would , of course , be okay with the term applying force as it seems to have a broader support in the room . Finally , we are , of course , happy to discuss topic 2 and 3 during the intersessional period . I thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
FINLAND,12:13:31,2024-03-08,0:02:30,"Mr. Chair , I refer the joint food for thought paper by Estonia and Finland back in 2018 . The content of the paper is partly outdated as our thinking has matured , but in order to help the characterization , we then introduced three categories that are still valid reflecting the discussion today . First , automatic , then autonomous and thirdly , independent . At first , automatic systems are not in the scope of our discussion as the system's response is defined in a deterministic way by default . Characterizing an autonomous system , we recognize the degree of autonomy being a spectrum and as mentioned , various weapons and projectiles do not have , excuse me , do have a certain binary moment , call it the point of no return following the launch or activation of the mission execution after which the human operator cannot affect the very likely lethal end result of the launch weaponized engagement . Responsible use of the autonomous system requires the understanding that the capabilities of the system are on par with the mission tasking , the contextual situation and the legal requirements and needed precautions . Beyond autonomy , we suggested the term or class of independent operation which would characterize an entity that does not exist at least for now , a system operating outside human involvement , a hypothetical system that would have a motivation and will of its own instead of tasking or agency by its responsible human operator . At least today , this category exists only in science fiction , but it is a category which could and should be banned as a future proof measure of the regulatory instrument . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
THE CIVILIAN AGENDA,12:16:08,2024-03-08,0:05:42,"I am just looking Thank you , Chair . If I may , I would like to make three points . The first one , to make a case in favor of deciding upon a definition , the need for a definition at this time . Secondly , to comment on the proposal that you made on the screen , Chair . And thirdly , where that proposal can be improved . Firstly , on the need for a definition . Chair , we have been doing these discussions for ten years . There has been a certain advantage to having an open exploratory discussion about what the risks are , what the potential prohibitions could be , what types of technologies we are dealing with . But over ten years now , we are seeing types of weapon systems that are using autonomy that we cannot concretely identify whether or not they are autonomous weapon systems . This means that a range of robotanks , sentry , territs and loitering munitions are so far evading any of the types of discussions , regulations or prohibitions that we are having over here . And so there is an urgent need to decide upon a definition in order to prohibit and regulate certain types of weapon systems and also to allow those who are in the research design and manufacture of such systems to know whether or not their systems fall within the category . So we are at the stage where we cannot afford greater time to ruminate . My submission is that we do need to decide upon a definition . Chair , the definition that you offered on the screen was in my view a very proper culmination of states' positions on this . And I think even you footnoted where you found the words from that definition from various state papers . And as the ICRC identified it is very similar to the one that they have identified and it has got a number of good advantages to it . So we are looking at systems that upon activation select and engage targets with force without further human intervention . In my view , the great benefit of this definition is that it allows us to assess the technology at a certain vantage point , ie , the point of activation . And so we can say whether or not that operator or the chain of command relating to the activation of that system is able to use that system with a sufficient amount of predictability , understandability , explainability because we will know when the system is activated what the context is going to be when the system is going to be used and the operator ought to be able to exercise those criteria to know whether or not to use the system . So we have that benefit . There is a specific vantage point from which we are making the assessment . We can also then using that apply certain prohibitions and regulations at the design and manufacturing stage . So a designer of such a weapon system would need to make sure that their system is predictable , is explainable , is understandable such that when the operator is activating the system they feel confident about the effects of the attack . So there is a lot of benefit to this way of doing things . The alternative way that has been discussed throughout the GGE is to talk about behaviors and that has a lot of merit too . We could say that there is an obligation upon a user to predict , to understand , et cetera . These are regulating and prohibiting types of behaviors . The disadvantage of that is that what are we then prohibiting in terms of the technology ? So we do need to concretely identify a vantage point from which we are going to make the assessments about the technology to see whether it is compatible with IHL , predictability , understandability , et cetera . But there is a fatal flaw which I set out on Monday during my opening statement with the definition that is being proposed which is that if we were to look at the actual systems that are in development , virtually all of them have some form of input that takes place after the system's activation . Now if we were to go with the word intervention then potentially any such input , no matter how meager or nominal would take that system completely outside of the framework that we are discussing here . It is a loophole . It is a way to subvert the framework and indeed we are seeing weapons manufacturers explicitly state that there is some form of input after activation such that it is not an autonomous weapon system . Even though it raises the same concerns that we have been discussing here for ten years such as concerns around accountability , responsibility , distinction and ethical considerations . So we should not allow some loophole to subvert the framework that we are using . And there is a solution to this . There are many potential solutions to this . One potential solution is to exchange the word intervention with agency and agency here would mean the undertaking of moral and legal responsibility . But what I am suggesting is that this particular loophole needs to be addressed because we should not be doing our work in a vacuum but to look at the actual systems that are of concern and see how we can address those concerns . So we are doing a workshop today in building H between 1 : 30 to 2 : 30 . Hopefully an intellectual kind of exercise to engage with this and I invite states to join with that . Thank you , Chair .",Non-applicable,No
JAPAN,12:21:50,2024-03-08,0:01:38,"Thank you , Mr. Chairperson . And I really appreciate your chairmanship for leading this very constructive and interesting exchanges . And out of these exchanges I have just two comments to make . The first with regard to the Chinese Delegations very important point on the purpose of the discussion on these characteristics . Japan supports the idea that the weapons with such characteristics should be to no , characterization of these weapons should be to define the scope of our discussion rather than for the ban on weapons with such by such characteristics . And the second point was regarding the debate on whether the scope of the characteristics is narrow or broad . Japan's position is that all discussions should be based upon the past agreements . So I understand the Chairperson's current languages is based on past agreements . And Japan supports discussions based on the Chair's language . Thank you .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
ITALY,12:23:39,2024-03-08,0:04:24,"Thank you , Chair . I would like to make some comments about on the paper that you presented on revisiting topic 1 . I would like to thank the you for the efforts that you have put into this . I think that we this paper shows the extent to which the debate has progressed in just a few days . I think it is from our point of view rather encouraging because we are beginning to narrow down the concepts that were very general and we seem to getting closer to a definition that could be workable . Or characterization could be workable possibly for most Delegations . As you know , we support the two - tier principle and we think it is not just a conceptual tool but also a practical way to approach future negotiations on an instrument because once you define a fully autonomous weapons system , a new state that that fully autonomous weapons system is to be prohibited , meaning it has not to be it should not be developed , produced , deployed . It should be completely banned . Then it follows that you will it will be easier to define what kind of limitations should be foreseen for systems that are , in fact , not fully autonomous bearing in mind that we view the key issue as the key function as the final one which is the decision to apply force or to engage , to use another expression . Going back to the paper that you presented , I think that as far as we are concerned , we also think that the word "" activated "" is not necessary and when you say that a system can identify , select and engage , that implies that it has been activated , in fact . We think that these three words should cover all situations that are relevant for this definition , meaning that when we talk about engage , either we say engage or we say apply force , we are we think that we should not define what kind of force it is because as I said in a previous intervention , we think that a weapon system can be devised as not being lethal but it can be applied in a certain context with lethal consequences . So it is better not to define what kind of force we are talking about but rather leave it general . And finally , when we talk about human intervention , we think that human intervention is too broad a concept . We prefer the concept of involvement because it is clear , involvement actually of an operator because human intervention could be anyone , could be it is not sufficiently focused but as I said also in a previous intervention , I think that we look with favor at the concept of agency because , in fact , we are not talking about just operating the system . We are talking about making decisions , making decisions on , you know , what to what target to engage and this is crucial because at the end of the day we are talking about international humanitarian law and responsibility of an agent , someone who should be responsible under international humanitarian law for the operation of a system and as I said , for the final decision along the various critical functions that is that of applying force engaging a target . Thank you . I would like to thank my Italian colleague for sharing his views . So far we have gone through the list of speakers but we still have some time . If you would like to react to your colleagues in this truly interactive debate , I must say .",Western European and other States,Yes
AUSTRIA,12:28:33,2024-03-08,0:01:59,"Thank you . Once again , being interactive , make a point of differentiation once again between the definition , the broad definition that we are putting up here and any kind of different definition that we will make later use for prohibition and regulations and just to illustrate why , because we have now had a discussion about the point , using the type , the use of human intervention , human agency . If you look at our working paper , the most exact formulation that actually really should be the one in our view to be used when we talk about prohibitions and regulations would be those authorizing any use of a weapon system that integrates autonomy in its critical functions . In our view , this is quite exact because it is first . It encompasses the person should in fact be one who has the ability to use and the opportunity to lead the agent actively . It is a broad definition . Thanks a lot , Robyn Hall . Carbon at Security , PLaN , the German습니까 and our panel , a piece of the human formulation , was from Germany and I hope it is not 6 . We have actually moved on . We have the scheduled meeting to July after the international meeting in Toronto and this is quite exact , because it is broad and it encompasses the person who in effect should be the one who has to make sure that the use of these weapon systems is complied with IHL , but at the same time , this kind of formulation is not useful in a broad definition and we are fully aware of that . So there might be the problem that we need a very broad and easy and not creating too many different interpretations and problems definition and this in our view is the human intervention and then later on when we talk about prohibitions and regulations be more precise . And even there , there might be in the end the difference between the formulation that is used in the prohibitions and regulations part . We prefer it to be probably a very similar one , but this is also an option . So just to make this point , do not mix those two things too much , but have an easy definition that is broad , functional and simple and have the detailed discussions later on . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
AUSTRALIA,12:30:43,2024-03-08,0:01:37,"Thank you , Chair . Just in the spirit of interactive discussion , we would like to respond to the suggestion made by a few Delegations earlier that the use of the term "" operator "" in a definition of laws could impact the scope of accountability for the use of laws and also to the comments made by ICRC regarding the term "" operator . "" We understand that we are currently seeking to define laws to indicate the broad type of weapons that we are currently talking about . And we see this as separate from considerations of accountability . We do not think that a particular characterization of laws would impact upon the scope of accountability which goes to principles of liability . So we would welcome some further clarification from Delegations that see a link between the definition of laws and accountability . Along similar lines to what ICRC suggested , we consider that the word "" the "" before "" operator "" could potentially be changed to an "" to avoid any perception that the ability to intervene would be limited to one person . We think that the word "" operator "" could include individuals at different levels , including a commander . We also agree with the ICRC that the term "" users "" might be a broader concept than "" operator , "" and we will give that suggestion some further consideration . Thank you . Thank you very much .",Western European and other States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,12:32:31,2024-03-08,0:03:45,"Thank you , Distinguished Chair . As a result of the discussion that has taken place , we would like to briefly draw attention only to one part of this particular discussion and draw attention to what was said by the Distinguished Ambassador of India . It is our view that he made a very important point on the need to define exactly what part of the spectrum of automated and autonomous weapons systems we are examining in this group . As a result of these discussions , we see that we are experiencing some confusion as to this understanding . This , to a great extent , stems from different national realities in the definition of automated and autonomous weapons systems . However , of course , if we wish to continue this discussion , the subject matter for discussion needs to be clearly defined . This is particularly relevant given the fact that a series of Delegations are basing their understanding on fully autonomous systems and on partially or semi-autonomous systems . However , in discussing the issue of definition and characteristics , we have suddenly seen that fully autonomous systems are understood by a series of Delegations only as weapons systems where three functions which have been highlighted , the identification , selection and engagement of the target are autonomous . So what do you then call the other systems ? The other weapons systems ? Absolutely autonomous ? We really need clarity on this , Chair . I think that here there is a serious amount of confusion which is leading some Delegations off the point and leading us away from a common understanding even as to exactly what we have come here to discuss . We count on you and your team facilitating the tasks of Delegations to achieve a common understanding , one unified understanding on this matter . Thank you . Well , I would say we are giving it a try . That was why I shared my reflections yesterday . Some of you are already calling it a paper or whatever . It was my reflections put in writing and then circulated for the purpose of exactly having this discussion and also responding to some of the remarks by Distinguished Delegates . Yeah , this is still sharing thoughts . This is still reflecting . We are not drafting but as I said to some of you , we are also not just a deliberative body or debating club . We have a very clear mandate and there are a lot of expectations around , not in the least from the Secretary General of the United Nations . The High Representative reminded us of that again and certainly to be able to respond to that , to fulfill our mandate , I am still of the opinion that we have to do work on the definition and characterizations . I think some very wise words were also spoken by the Distinguished Delegate of Pakistan that we might have to revisit this . I think also the Distinguished Representative of Austria came with that . What we are doing now could be different once we discuss possible prohibition of regulations and measures . We have to see that but I think this debate clearly shows that that this is an effort we have to continue also in the intersessional period and probably have to revisit it at our next meeting because it goes to the heart of the matter . It is not just for intellectual purposes that I would like to come to a text or something .",Eastern European States,Yes
BULGARIA,12:38:33,2024-03-08,0:01:54,"Thank you , Chair . I apologize for jumping in in the last minute but due to some untypical force major circumstances I only received your paper this morning . So I have some short remarks . Thank you for successfully guiding us through the first week and this revision definitely helps narrowing down our work . On the question of once activated , we do not consider it to be superfluous concept . On the contrary , it is one of the relevant aspects of laws , especially in connection with human intervention . The US proposal of after activation I guess also works for us . On identify , select and engage , we would like to go for all three of these together . As Germany said and shared by Luxembourg , identification is important especially in relation to potential biases . We would consider select and engage to be cumulative as Australia and ICRC suggested . For identification , we could have a similar position . However , we would like to give it a further consideration on this issue . We would go for apply force and as we said earlier this week , we were convinced by others that the term human intervention in combination with the word further is more appropriate option . When it comes to characterization , we are also willing to give further consideration to the ICRC proposal for inclusion of human user as more broader that includes not only operators but also other persons within the chain of command . Thank you , Mr. Chairman . Thank you for this . Yes , this is it . No further requests for the floor . I am not going to try and summarize this discussion at this moment . There is of course always the saying that you have given each other a lot of food for thought but that is simply true this time . And you have also I would say given us a lot of homework in now putting all those reflections next to each other and to see indeed where are the points of convergence and where we still need to find solutions for differences . I would also tend to be inclined to say that we should not try to make it much longer . We should try to keep it short . But , of course , it should cover the essential aspects of a working understanding that we really know what we are talking about . There is , of course , a link to future work . There were a lot of references to that . And that is true . So we can also not endlessly continue this discussion . So this is one of the top items on our list I would say for the intercessional period . But I am not going to say much more about that now because I have some closing remarks and that is work in progress . That is also a bit of a moving target in the light of the discussion of this morning and I think we have been very wise not yet to finalize it because we have to do some further work on that also in the light of this discussion we had this morning . I am almost tempted to say that next meeting should always start on a Friday because it seems to be tradition indeed within this group that the later in the day , the later in the week , the more forward the discussions are and in the past we have , of course , had a number of occasions where we were not able to harvest thoughts that had been developed throughout the week because there had to be done work on the report . This time that is not the case . So we will continue working on what you have said and try to develop that for further discussion . But that is all I am now going to say because already I am going to in my closing remarks , I think . I see we are a little bit early but I would say there is compensation for that for all the work you have done yesterday evening and overnight and early this morning . So you have a little bit of a longer lunch break . I would like to invite you to come back at 3 o'clock . Then we have other matters on our agenda . I already explained that there is not any other business , please , not any other business because it is related business to our mandate and to the work we are doing . It is also a result of discussions we had in the run- up to this week where we had to explain that we had a certain focus on the three topics but that there were , of course , a lot of other topics to be addressed and that we would find space within the indicative timetable to address that and to hear your views . So with that in mind , I would now like to adjourn the meeting . Have a good lunch . See you at 3 o'clock sharp preferably .",Eastern European States,Yes
