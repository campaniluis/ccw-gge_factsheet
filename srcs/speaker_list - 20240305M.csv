ITALY,10:15:08,2024-03-05,0:05:11,"Thank you , Chair . I would like to thank you and the Secretariat for showing these elements on screen . I think it is a very helpful and useful method . In fact , looking at this yesterday , I mean , we could see how far we have moved on these issues , but also how far we still have to go . And having listened yesterday to the different statements , we would also like to contribute some comments . The first bullet concerning the question of the emphasis on technology rather than on weapons systems , we understand the argument of those that point out that we should start from systems rather than from technologies , although this second approach has its merits , too . We think that the question lies with the combination of technologies with weapons systems . Emerging technologies are not good or bad in themselves . It is the use we make of them . Also , there are technologies that can be applied to many human activities . They may be dual use or they may have been developed for completely different purposes and then applied to weapons systems or they may have been developed exactly having in mind a weapons system . So in this case , it is more difficult to conceptually separate the technology from the weapons systems . Anyway , we think that we can work on a different way to phrase these concepts . I think it is perfectly within our reach . Now , all the bullets read together in the different combinations , they give a characterization and definitions of laws that could be useful when considering completely autonomous weapons systems . In our approach , laws that operate completely outside human control and a responsible chain of command should be prohibited . However , the issue here is also as far as we can see bullet 4 and the type of force these systems apply . Is this any type of force or should we qualify the force as lethal ? This brings us to a point raised by several Delegations yesterday in the sense that for us , as is the case for others , the main reference is IHL . We operate within the CCW and the goal is to limit the use of certain weapons , to limit the use of certain weapons and these limits are set by international humanitarian law , which is why we still have issues like others with the addition of lethal to autonomous weapons systems . For two reasons , one , what makes an autonomous weapon lethal ? Is it because it has been conceived as such or is it because it can have indirect lethal consequences although these are not intended in its original design ? Secondly , a violation of IHL can also happen when the consequences are not lethal . It can apply to grave injuries or also as someone noted yesterday to damage to certain objects . We realize this question has been discussed over and over but we believe that it remains relevant . On bullet 3 , we think that the three elements of identify , select and engage are probably sufficient for what we need to cover . On the final bullet , the word "" further "" is certainly key . We need to reflect on how specific we want to be when it comes to human intervention or involvement , whether it is necessary to refer to the individual operator and what that implies in terms of decision making , which is also why we look with interest at the definition of human agency . This entire sentence , this entire definition conforms the basis for determining not only laws , completely autonomous systems but also systems which will be regulated , which have autonomous functions . If you remove or change one of the elements that made up the entire definition , then you have a system that is not fully automated and therefore in our view needs to be regulated . I thank you , Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
FRANCE,10:20:38,2024-03-05,0:06:55,"The floor is to the Ambassador of France . Thank you very much , Chair . To begin , I would like to thank you for the way in which you have led our work , you and your entire team . We have seen since yesterday that we were able to have an in - depth discussion and that is the outcome of the way in which you prepared our work . I would also like to make my gratitude coextensive to the support unit , of course . Addressing the point under consideration , I would like to offer a few comments and details . Beginning with the principles , given that we have spoken a great deal , that is fortunate , about a lethal autonomous weapons system as many Delegations have pointed out including India , it is part and parcel of the way in which we characterize the scope of the instrument and that is the way in which we have structured the dual approach which prohibits an initial category of weapons because it is incompatible with international humanitarian law and the other one which tries to address a second category of weapons . So first , on the distinction between the systems that are fully autonomous and the systems that integrate autonomy . So the former , fully autonomous , they operate without human oversight . They themselves can appoint for themselves targets in a complicated environment and over and above their initial programming without being subjected at all to the command chain . Whereas for the second category , that is systems that include autonomy , they are always under human control which is why we call partially autonomous weapons systems . So in this latter category , the decision - taking functions of the system are supported to human intervention and under their responsibility and this is an important criteria to bear in mind , responsibility . And this partially autonomous system can also be endowed for a restricted space and under certain guarantees to carry out some tasks that are part of critical aspects such as identification , classification , interception or engaging . So I wanted to clearly highlight this difference between autonomous and partially autonomous . Then the second point that was debated greatly yesterday was the criterion of lethal . I would like to point out that lethal is a part of the mandate of our GGE since its very inception and that was in order to address an ethical concern of a machine that can choose to take the life of a human being . Further , the broadening of the mandate would be counterproductive . Why ? Well , because that would bring the discussions would make them even more difficult than they are today and several Delegations including our own believe that it is urgent to act . So it would not be appropriate to broaden the scope of the mandate . Third , we must recall that as part of our approach all weapons systems including nonlethal weapons systems are nevertheless subjected to IHL to prohibit suffering an excessive injury and indiscriminate use of these weapons . So all those that are incompatible with IHL must be banned . And this brings me to the comments on what we have on the screen . On the first one , we prefer to speak of lethal weapons systems based on technologies because it is the weapons systems that are at the core of the subject under consideration and several Delegations yesterday or in their documents including Switzerland , Japan , the United States , China and Mexico . Moving on to the second bullet point , it seems to us that stating once activated is necessary because it is actually the activation , the point at which a human being will give the machine a certain level of autonomy at which point the critical functions that are at the heart of our argumentation will be activated . The Cuban Delegation also pointed this out . On the third bullet point , the three functions that are in our view are essential are identify , select and engage as outlined by the Philippines as well . Track lies between selection and engagement . So that is an option too . We do not need to get rid of it and I believe it was proposed by South Korea . So these terms are cumulative given that there is a continuum that will lead to lethal action . So they are not alternatives to each other . When considering military activity on the ground , we prefer apply force on the fourth bullet point . Why do we prefer that ? Because it is more operational than deploy force . And then on the fifth bullet point , we are leaning towards without further human intervention as proposed by Costa Rica because it is more all encompassing wording . Human intervention by an operator seems to bear in mind only the end of the activation and it does not consider the whole command chain that will lead into the final order . Thank you very much for considering my first responses and reactions . Thank you . Thank you very much for these detailed comments .",Western European and other States,Yes
EL SALVADOR,10:27:46,2024-03-05,0:02:52,"Thank you very much for giving me the floor , Mr. Chair . As this is the first time that I am taking the floor , I would like to commend you on your appointment as Chair of this GGE and I would like to pledge the constructive support of my Delegation to your tenure . Additionally , I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my Delegation's support to the statements made yesterday by the Delegation of Pakistan speaking on behalf of a group of countries and by the Delegation of Costa Rica speaking on behalf of the G15 . Turning my comments now to the text presented yesterday , I would like to join other Delegations that expressed their congratulations to you for this initiative . Preliminarily , I would like to offer some general reactions to this proposal . We have listened closely to yesterday's discussions and in our view , a broad majority of Delegations gathered in this room agree on many items . This encourages us and gives us hope to move forward . As we are part of the group that presented a proposal for the Sixth Protocol , we agree with the view that lethal significantly limits the scope of these weapons due to the fact that as many have said already , a weapon can bring about serious consequences in international law , particularly international humanitarian law without necessarily being lethal . In addition to many other reasons that were broadly debated in this forum . On the first bullet item , we support Switzerland's proposals and made by other countries as well to bring about this change and focus on the weapon systems that have emerged in technologies . On the second bullet point , we agree with the United Kingdom and that there is a need to take into account the levels of autonomy that these systems have given that as Mexico said , for my Delegation , it is essential when the time comes to set up regulations and prohibitions . So with that in mind , and using as a reference what has been proposed in the Sixth Protocol , for my Delegation , the critical functions for autonomy could be select , target , engage , and we also take into account apply force . On the last bullet item , we believe that it is essential to keep a component on human intervention . We would even consider a human operator . To conclude , I would like to express my gratitude to civil society and other relevant actors for their research and investigation which allows us to have a better understanding of the subject . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
GUATEMALA,10:30:52,2024-03-05,0:01:43,"Thank you , Chair . I would like to join other Delegations in expressing their gratitude to you for sharing this detailed document and all of the information compiled by the information provided on the members of the group . My Delegation believes that the International Red Cross Committee has already provided us with a good definition of these systems , setting out that it is those systems that select and apply force against targets without human control . We believe that the definitions of these systems must be based on lethal autonomous weapon systems that include autonomy within their critical functions to select or to identify , to engage with and apply force without human intervention . So we support what was said at the point in this room , calling for the express inclusion of the definition of human intervention given that the definition of intervention by an operator is ambiguous that could be open to varying interpretations . Further , we agree that there must be an explicit mention of the definition of what weapons that use emerging technologies is and not simply technologies writ large which is why we support the proposal of other Delegations to begin by speaking of weapons and not technologies so as not to create the feeling that we are saying that technologies per se are the problem but rather it is the use of these technologies in weapons . Lastly , we call on all to have a constructive dialogue such as the one that we have had thus far , one in which we can arrive at a definition that will continue over time and that it will not become obsolete as soon as the document is adopted bearing in mind the quick speed with which these new technologies evolve and their use in lethal autonomous weapon systems . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
BULGARIA,10:33:01,2024-03-05,0:02:09,"First the floor is to Bulgaria . You have the floor . Thank you , Mr. Chairman . Yesterday afternoon we had a pretty constructive discussion on the guiding question 1 . Our Delegation is in favor of your approach that is based on the guiding questions and the replies submitted . We would like to shortly jump in to share our initial thoughts on bullet 1 similar to other Delegations . We would prefer the focus to be on weapon systems , not on technology itself . Bullet 2 , I think we have a common agreement that once activated is appropriate term . On bullet 3 for us it is necessary to have identification selection and engagement . It is the better option out of the ones we have on the screen . On bullet 4 we would go for apply force . It is a better term . On the last bullet in our reply to the guiding questions we have human involvement . However the discussion managed to convince us that the term human intervention in a combination with the word further is a more appropriate option when it comes to defining autonomous weapon systems . Lastly regarding the notion of fatality it is a quite controversial topic within the GGE . Over the years we have heard numerous confronting views on the issue and having in mind yesterday the deliberations , the situation does not have the prospect to be resolved soon . For the record our Delegation does not consider fatality to be an inherent characteristics of autonomous weapon systems . Still we have a clear understanding that fatality is part of our mandate . Thank you , Mr. Chairman .",Eastern European States,Yes
PAX,10:35:18,2024-03-05,0:03:10,"For approach you have set out and I think it is a very productive way of moving the discussion forward . To start with a few general remarks , as you mentioned the definition of the ICRC is often referred to by various Delegations . I think this definition could be seen as a working definition to further our work . As I understand it a final legal definition is usually agreed upon during the official negotiation process which would mean a working definition could be sufficient at this stage to move discussions forward . So putting forward States' positions I think is very useful at this stage . At the same time I think we should be careful of the position mentioned by some that we need a completely agreed definition before we can move forward on other issues . At this stage a working definition should be sufficient . Some thoughts on your text on the screen . First of all , technologies that enable I think is a very useful phrasing . As we see autonomy as a function of a weapon system . An autonomous weapon system is not the same as a land mine or cluster munition which is an inherent thing in itself . We see it as the way a weapon system is used that would make it autonomous . It is not the characteristic of the weapon itself but the way it is used . The second point once activated I think that is also useful as it demonstrates there are two phases , namely before activation and after activation . The first phase the human decides to activate the weapon system after making a legal and ethical judgment ensuring human control . The second phase then is a period of time where the weapon system would function autonomously . So I think the delineation of those two phases is useful . On the third point I think the most important element is to include the use of force as this is what produces the effects of an attack which must comply with legal and ethical norms . Also the identification is relevant as it ensures the target to which force is applied is in line with the user's intent . At the same time I think as I mentioned the exact number of qualifiers mentioned here is not that important as long as we have a working definition on which we can move forward . Regarding the restriction of the definition to lethal force seems undesirable for reasons mentioned by various Delegations as well as the ICRC mentioned more eloquently than I ever could . So I will leave it there . I think with point 4 either option would be fine to include and on point 5 I think all phrasings have their pros and cons . But I think human intervention as used by the ICRC would work as it seems to be the most used phrasing and as I mentioned not getting into the nitty - gritty of agreeing on all the details but having phrasings that most states can agree on to move forward . Thank you , Chair . Thank you for your intervention .",Non-applicable,No
BRAZIL,10:38:42,2024-03-05,0:03:08,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . I asked for the floor again to react to some very interesting ideas and concepts that were presented in our debate yesterday and this morning and to clarify some of the points that we made yesterday . First point is that I just wanted to make it clear that we also concur on the proposal that was made by several Delegations and by ICRC yesterday on the need to focus on weapons systems and not on the technologies that underpin it . Our response might have been suggesting otherwise but it is merely a fact that it was structured on the basis of the guiding questions that we received which in turn was based on the mandates that this group has received . But our preference is , of course , that we focus on weapons systems . Second point on the third bullet which we discussed yesterday , the terms that will define the critical functions of autonomous weapons systems , very interesting ideas and concerns were raised yesterday , particularly about the need for them to be sequential and for all of these concepts to be necessary in order for the qualification to apply . We had indicated in our response that identify , select and engage would be our preference but if we are to boil down to what is absolutely critical for the definition in terms of the relevance to IHL perhaps select and engage would be the best option . My third point is regarding the fourth bullet in which I would like to point out that we agree with the statement of Australia yesterday that this might be redundant given the fact that we have engage in the previous bullet but if we are to use a formulation like this our preference would be to apply force because it would be more precise . Lastly on the fifth bullet , again I believe that human intervention or the alternative formulation intervention by an operator would be the best and this relates to the comments made yesterday by the Distinguished Delegation from India and today by the Distinguished Delegation of France . I think at this point we are not concerned yet about prohibitions . We are concerned about delimiting our field of work and prohibitions and restrictions would , of course , follow and depend on further characterization but here we are just stating what the overall field of concern is and the risk of adopting the definition on the other formulations involvement of the operator would be to lead to the understanding that this definition only applies to fully autonomous weapons , thereby excluding all other semi-autonomous systems from our concerns . So we need to be a bit broader here without this necessarily signifying that we are to prohibit or restrict each and every system that is endowed with some degree of autonomy . Thank you very much , Chair .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,10:42:04,2024-03-05,0:22:08,"Thank you very much , Distinguished Chair . At the outset I would like to thank my Distinguished Colleagues from other Delegations and also representatives of NGOs for the ideas that they presented that should help us in our work . I would like to make several comments in light of what was said by colleagues . I will try to react to some of the ideas that were presented . First , we would like to refer to statements about the fact that definitions and agreeing on the specific characteristics of such systems may be something that is superfluous for the objectives of this group . Well , I would like to say that we are quite surprised and we hope we are not the only ones who are surprised but other Delegations as well , especially when such statements or claims are made by Delegations in other forum that are involved in questions of arms control , disarmament and nonproliferation where they are really in favor of definitions of any weapons systems if , of course , we are talking about developing or elaborating agreements including at the level of certain understandings that are binding . They say that all should be specifically and directly defined and that is being presented as a key element of any type of agreement and in fact is presented as a category , the absence of which may put into question the very elaboration of any agreement on an issue . So we believe that this is a clear example of double standards and if indeed we are talking about such serious matters like lethal autonomous weapons systems , then here we have to talk about a clear definition of what we are talking about , what we are discussing , especially in a situation where in international law we do not have any universal definition of laws and we also do not have any real functioning prototypes of such systems . Without the elaboration of such a definition and be very difficult not only to talk about the elaboration of any agreements , it would simply be extremely difficult to discuss these issues because we will not have a specific understanding of what we are talking about , what each state understands when they refer to laws because as we have seen from our discussion today , each state seems to understand this very notion in their own particular way , including both in the categories of weapon systems that fall under such title and also what characteristics are part of such a notion . Any limitations without a clear definition of lethal autonomous weapons systems may lead to legal uncertainty and also have an impact on a broad set of weapon systems and also have a negative impact on scientific and technological progress including in the area of peaceful robotics and artificial intelligence and some colleagues referred to that yesterday . This is why we must focus on the elements of a possible definition that we believe are already appearing . For us , we do not have any questions about what we should be talking about , technologies or weapon systems . We are very clear that we must talk about weapon systems . This is something that has been already enshrined in the previous reports of the GGE where we agreed on the basis of consensus numerous understandings related to weapon systems based on emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapon systems . However , in order to come up with such a clear definition , we cannot define lethal autonomous weapon systems through the notion of a weapon system . Here once again we can recall the lengthy discussions that we had with our dear colleagues , especially representing the western countries in different international fora where these colleagues are demanding that we have a definition of the notion of a weapon system or the notion of a weapon . I believe that this form is not an exception . We must clearly understand what we mean when we say weapon system . As far as we are concerned , when we refer to weapon systems , we understand that these are technical means that carry out military or other auxiliary objectives in support of the military objectives . And such an understanding of a weapon system refers both to a military weapon system but also a dual type weapon system . This is something that is very important to keep in mind in order to not create any artificial limitations on the notion of lethal autonomous weapon system . And we would like to point out that there is no contradiction here with the notion of lethality because dual use systems , just like systems that play a support role or are aimed at or have as an objective to carry out a support role can inflict lethal harm from the point of view of international humanitarian law . And this is something that we should also keep in mind . This is very important in order not to break down such a definition by limiting its scope , lethal autonomous weapon system , not to separate lethal autonomous weapon systems into good weapon systems and bad weapon systems . And in light of the discussion that we are having now , then we will be only referring to bad weapon systems that without the intervention of operator would identify , select and engage targets . And all the other weapon systems then will turn out to be legitimate , absolutely acceptable weapon systems . So we believe that this is a selective approach that is not really acceptable when we discuss this issue . And we must talk about the category of weapon systems including lethal autonomous weapon systems in a comprehensive manner if indeed we are planning to come up with a definition . Besides this does not refer to any potential limitations or so - called prohibitions that already exist in IHL . As we define such prohibitions or our understandings of such prohibitions that already exist in international humanitarian law , here we can talk about separate categories of lethal autonomous weapon systems . But since we are talking about a definition , a general definition of this category as a whole , we have to take a holistic and comprehensive approach to such a definition . And here we have to talk about a very broad category of systems , military systems , dual use systems as well that are intended for the implementation of military objectives or in support of military operations . And here we believe that it is quite justified to leave outside of such definitions the notion of munitions that already exist . And this definition has been in existence for a very long time and this category can be easily considered as a lethal autonomous weapon system because very often such weapons operate without the intervention of an operator . And that category of systems has been clearly regulated in the past and continues to be regulated by existing norms of IHL and something that is being discussed in international forum does not require any additional discussions here in this GGE related to munitions . Now on the question of autonomy , another very important factor that should be kept in mind when we work on a definition of a lethal autonomous weapon system . Now many colleagues said that we should not try to to separate weapon systems on the basis of the level of autonomy and to put on the table here the discussion of weapon systems with a high level of autonomy . We share this approach . We do not think that in this GGE we are only talking about lethal autonomous weapon systems . For us , the notion of autonomy and autonomous systems means that autonomy is meant to be a complete autonomy . In other words , when a weapon system operates without the intervention or involvement of an operator . And we consider this weapons category as a weapon system that operates without the involvement of the operator . And this qualifier is sufficient to define autonomous systems . All other systems are not autonomous . This could be highly automated systems , semi-autonomous systems or any other category of automated systems . And they should be considered outside of the work of this GGE . And this we believe is the understanding that led to the recommendations that were prepared by this group in previous years . We also share the point of view that the definition should be meant for the long - term . It should include the possibilities of future developments of such systems and not simply be limited to any current understanding of a lethal autonomous weapon system . The definition should be a universal one as the expert community understands it . And this should include the views of academics , engineers , military staff , ethical specialists and others . And even though we are discussing this within the framework of the CCW , the definition should take into account the need to strike the right balance between the legitimate security concerns of states and humanitarian considerations . And as we work on a definition of a lethal autonomous weapon system , we also believe that we should refrain from taking any hasty decisions that may create obstacles to technological progress . We should also keep in mind views on technologies and how society looks at society can change as time goes by as we acquire additional experience in the use of such technologies . So such definition should be a comprehensive one as we said earlier . We also would like to make a couple of comments on the different notions , ideas that were expressed by different Delegations . Some of these things have been voiced already in the past , especially the introduction of such notions as meaningful human control , the forms and levels of human involvement and also to reflect in the notions related to laws of a category that has nothing to do in general with law . This is something that we heard in the past . We believe that such approaches do not really help us find effective solutions with characteristics and definitions and also such value judgment as critically important or important already contained within themselves the risks of politicization as we tried to define this category of weapon systems . Also , the definition of lethal autonomous weapon systems based purely on factors related to human control would hardly help us achieve a common understanding of what these systems are without having the necessary criteria for ensuring human control over machines and we would like to point out once again that we believe that these criteria are superfluous because the specific forms or methods of such control should be left in the hands of states that have the responsibility for ensuring such control in line with existing norms of IHL . Definitions of lethal autonomous weapon systems based purely on critical functions that exist in highly automated weapon systems are also we believe counterproductive . So we do not believe that we need to discuss in the context of laws under the CCW . We should not be discussing the issue of unmanned aerial vehicles because this is simply one example of a highly automated weapon system and does not belong to the category of lethal autonomous weapon systems . As I already said , only relate to fully autonomous weapon systems that do not involve human beings . Now if we now look at the bullet points that we see on the screen , then as we already said , under the first bullet point we should be talking about weapon systems . Now on the second bullet point we believe that this bullet point is superfluous just like the third bullet point because the second and third bullet point , they boil the category of lethal autonomous weapon systems down to only one category of such weapon systems , a very narrow category of weapon systems leaving aside all the other categories of laws and as a result if we take the second and third bullet point and include them in the definition this will mean that entire categories and types of lethal autonomous weapon systems will simply not fall under the definition of laws and that is something of course is unthinkable if indeed we want to come up with an effective applicable definition . Once again I will say we have to talk about military systems , dual use systems that are meant to carry out military tasks or support tasks leaving aside only the category of munitions , a category that has for a long time been effectively regulated by international humanitarian law and we have no problems there . Now as far as the fourth bullet point is concerned here we have the same situation . It is superfluous indeed if the objective of this bullet point is to remove certain categories of weapon systems while we find this surprising and we are somewhat bewildered if that is indeed the approach . Now on the final bullet point here we believe an attempt is made to define autonomy in weapon systems and we believe that this bullet point can fully cover the category of autonomy and the understanding that a weapon system operates without any involvement of an operator can fully define the autonomy of such a weapon system . Now on the term operator this is a well known term . This is a term that is used in practice both the military and technical level , the applied level related highly automated systems that already exist today , systems that are functioning and are being employed by different countries . So this is a term that is relevant for the definition of laws . It is a very specific term in comparison to , for example , the term human involvement . We do not really understand what that means from a legal point of view . Thank you very much .",Eastern European States,Yes
COLOMBIA,11:04:29,2024-03-05,0:01:47,"Colombia , the floor is yours . Thank you , Chair . We acknowledge how difficult it is to have a specific definition . But at the same time we do know that a definition is needed in order to have a legally binding instrument . The methodology that you have proposed is in our mind quite useful because it allows us to deliberate in order to better identify the components of the definition which is why my Delegation believes that a Delegation cannot be fully detailed and fleshed out because something with too many details could limit the scope of the instrument that we want to negotiate . Nor do I have an ideal formulation for the definition but I imagine that is part of the challenge of our work and your work when preparing a report , the report of the meeting . The challenge to have this definition balanced and general and specific at the same time and also well structured enough to meet our ends . My Delegation also believes that what is essential in this definition are not technologies per se but rather the autonomous weapons systems . That is the critical characteristic of weapons systems that we want to define is the autonomous capabilities they have whether or not they are fully or semi-autonomous . I think I do not need to further elaborate on this idea because many of the Delegations that spoke before me have done so already . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
ALGERIA,11:06:29,2024-03-05,0:02:20,"Thank you , Chair . I would like to thank the various Delegations for their contributions and relevant comments which have allowed us to better limit the concept so as to avoid any issues whenever we are tackling a definition and the characteristics of laws . Well , first , we agree with what has been said already by some Delegations about the importance of doing away with any and all ambiguity or confusion that could come about from the first sentence which might lead one to believe that the problem is linked to emerging technologies whereas , in fact , the issue arrives from autonomous weapons systems that use emerging technologies and the problem is not within emerging technologies themselves . Secondly , we believe that the definition of laws is a delicate task given that the technological development could make it outdated . That means that we have to focus more on the characteristics . On the fifth bullet point , perhaps we should use human control of autonomous weapons systems instead of human intervention given that the term enshrined in the disarmament community is the weapons control . Fourth , lethality is a defining element of our discussions according to the mandate given to this group seeing as the CCW is a key instrument for international law . Lastly , I would like to state that in our view the joint declaration from the Delegation of Pakistan on behalf of the G15 addresses the organization of the many points that ought to be discussed over the course of this session and that joint statement should be considered in order to allow the scope of the discussion to be broadened following an inclusive and general approach . Thank you .",African States,Yes
CANADA,11:09:03,2024-03-05,0:03:02,"Thank you , Chair . Firstly , as this is the first time my Delegation is taking the floor , I would like to congratulate you in assuming the role of Chair and you can count on my Delegation's full support . We also greatly appreciate the manner in which you are conducting this meeting as we are very interested in our current discussion . Regarding the text on the screen , my Delegation wishes to contribute some comments for consideration . On the first bullet , technologies that enable versus weapon systems , my Delegation believes that we should focus on autonomous weapon systems and not emerging technologies and furthermore as some of other Delegations have highlighted and indicated , we believe that we should also be inserting the concept of fully autonomous to our discussion . Systems that are fully autonomous would leave no room for appropriate human involvement and would be unacceptable on that basis and as we know , war must remain at its roots a human enterprise . On the second bullet , my Delegation's preference would also be on once activated , however , we would caution that once activated seems to imply that a human will activate the autonomous weapon system , yet the use of the passive voice here leaves open the possibility that some other autonomous systems could activate . On the next bullet , my Delegation's preference here would be to identify , select and engage . Subsequent bullet , we would agree with apply force and under further direct or concurrent , we prefer further . Further intervention by a human is also acceptable for my Delegation . It does imply that there is some initial intervention by a human before activation or upon activation and it seems to rule out self - activation . We think this could be further explored as in theory a human might activate this autonomous weapon system in an environment where it can easily respect targeting rules , proportionality , the commander's intentions and other assigned requirements . Like most weapon systems , this autonomous weapon system might behave lawfully and in some situations or in other certain conditions , but not in other situations . We must also consider the operational context . And finally , intervention by a human operator , adding human could be a workable addition for my Delegation as it has a degree of clarity and this would need to be consistent throughout including human combatants , et cetera . I thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,11:15:07,2024-03-05,0:06:06,"Thank you , Distinguished Chair . We are grateful to you for preparing this support document that is purely informal and should help us in our work . On the very question , the question itself that you are putting to us here , we have some reservations here . We believe this question is not fully correct in light of the subject of our discussion . In our statement on definitions , we try to explain and provide some clarifications related to our positions , positions that we have when we look at the term lethal autonomous weapon system . This understanding , the understanding that we have is based on the idea that such lethal autonomous weapon systems are completely autonomous . So we cannot talk about the fact that some of the functions of the system are autonomous . All of these functions are implemented without any participation of an operator . We believe that the overall functioning of lethal autonomous weapon systems is being done or carried out without any participation of an operator . So any function of the system is carried out without the intervention of an operator . Indeed , if we are asking the question what functions are being implemented without the involvement of an operator , then in our understanding in this case we are not talking about lethal autonomous weapon systems and we are not talking about autonomy as such , but we are talking about automation in different degrees of automation and we would like to once again repeat that discussions of weapon systems with different levels of automation is not the subject of discussions here in this GGE . This is why if we talk about certain characteristics of lethal autonomous weapon systems , then one of such characteristics is complete full autonomy or simply autonomy because everything else , what is not autonomy will be to some extent or to one level or another , it will be autonomy . After automation , it will be automation and we believe that this is indeed a very important critical factor as we work on a definition of lethal autonomous weapon systems because if indeed we try to separate this or that critical function as something that has autonomy , then we are limiting the scope of our discussion and we are then we are not talking about autonomous weapon systems , but we are talking about different categories of automated systems . We find this counterproductive and we would prefer to continue our discussion that would be directly related only to lethal autonomous weapon systems . With due respect to the work that was carried out , we believe that this list simply is not in line with the subject of the discussions here in the GGE and in some way it narrows that scope and in fact it changes the very scope of the discussion , taking our discussion away from laws towards the discussion of weapon systems with different levels of automation . Thank you .",Eastern European States,Yes
COSTA RICA,11:21:44,2024-03-05,0:01:37,"First Costa Rica and then Austria . Costa Rica , you have the floor . Thank you , Chair . I had not planned to take the floor on this segment , but I am reacting to the comments that I have been listening to in the room . Yesterday we started our working session , my Delegation and a few others had kindly asked to begin working based on everything that the GGE had already been building and it is a real shame to hear how the work of the last three years is being ignored and instead there are efforts to promote a definition of one single vision of a subject when the vast majority of this room has pointed out numerous times that there is an intent to use the two - tier approach where there are some common elements that had already transcended the items that are being brought back into the discussion and I simply wanted to make my Delegation's position clear about the discussion of the so - called fully autonomous weapons . For Costa Rica , fully autonomous weapons are completely incompatible with IHL . We should waste neither time nor effort in this working group devoted to an effort that would not be bringing this discussion forward at all . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
AUSTRIA,11:23:45,2024-03-05,0:02:33,"We also just wanted to react to the discussion that we are having , especially to the discussion around the definition and characteristics coming again to a problem that could have been rather avoided or that is inherent to this whole discussion about definition and characteristics . If you talk about facts , then the Russian Federation is right on autonomous weapons is autonomous . That is very clear . And therefore , saying what kind of functions would be autonomous or talking about human intervention , if you are talking in this kind of terms , the Russian Federation is right . But in more practical terms , what we are seeing is that autonomy will be introduced in a wide range of weapon systems . It will be a function , as many Delegations have pointed out in the past , it will be on a spectrum . There will be different levels . This is just a practical reality that we will have to face in the future , a fully autonomous weapon systems as Costa Rica just has pointed out must be forbidden per se . This is very likely outcome of this group anyway . The problem that we are having here and this has been demonstrated very powerful once again by this discussion is that we do not actually need a definition . What we need is terms or formulations about prohibitions and regulations that clearly say what any weapon system should comply with . When it has autonomous functions , be they fully , semi or whatever or highly automated , what any kind of weapon systems should not do , what conditions must be met for it to be fully compliant with international law and also what kind of positive obligations should exist . This is the approach that we have taken now for many years , what is usually in most of the working papers and the way that we should also work in this group . So once again , the definitions discussion is useful in a sense so that we are more clear what we are talking about . But once again , as has been mentioned , we had had this discussion now for ten years . But the focus should not be on the definitions but what any weapon systems should not do when it has autonomous functions . Thanks .",Western European and other States,Yes
FRANCE,11:26:31,2024-03-05,0:01:32,"We believe that we should not backpedal . We have had debates over the previous sessions of this group and there is a distinction between fully autonomous systems and systems that integrate autonomy . That said , the regulation is not only for fully autonomous lethal weapon system , which is why the dual approach was used in the final report of the last session of this group . And that the mandate given to us for this new session is not limited to fully autonomous weapons . We should , however , bear in mind all the work that has been done up until now , including the eleven principles . This would not make any sense if we do not work with weapons systems , with fully autonomous lethal weapon systems . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
GERMANY,11:28:15,2024-03-05,0:00:50,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . Germany very much welcomes that we are able to discuss on the basis of concrete text elements and we agree with the speakers before us , such as France , who underlined the need to build up on the work that has been done until now . We consider considering the explanation or characterization and the question what functions of laws would be autonomous , we consider a fully autonomous weapon system or laws to be a system that operates completely outside of human control and a responsible chain of command . In this respect , it would , in our view , be relevant that laws would have autonomy in critical functions such as identification , selection and engagement of a target or targets . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,11:29:22,2024-03-05,0:06:04,"Thank you very much , Distinguished Chair . I would like to react to some of the comments that were made by colleagues . First of all , on the comment made by Costa Rica , we regret that our comment led to these feelings in the Delegate of Costa Rica . But we do not share such a disappointment . We believe that such a reaction simply confirms the importance that the elaboration of a single definition of law has because Delegations understand this notion differently and this has been the situation for many years . This is not the first time we are talking about this but unfortunately we are still sort of stuck in the same place . So we believe that with your help , Distinguished Chair , we will be able to move forward in this question and to figure out what lethal autonomous weapons systems are . And here we would like to stress in order to provide some encouragement to the Delegate of Costa Rica that our comment relates only to the subject for discussions by this GG , in other words , lethal autonomous weapons systems . And this does not mean that we are not open to discussion of weapons systems that have different level of automation . But that is simply a different issue that requires a separate discussion in a different format taking into account different inputs . Now on the comment made by Distinguished Delegate of Austria , then we would like to once again stress that the position on the need to have a terminological foundation related to different questions of disarmament arms control . And we should be consistent in that position . If in connection with separate issues we are talking about the strict need to have a definition , a definition of weapons , weapons systems , this should apply to all aspects and should be used in all fora . Now , the question of lethal autonomous weapons systems is not an exception . And if the Delegation of Austria changed its view , then we would like to hear about that and also see it said in other fora because we believe that would help us move forward on a set of other issues related to the elaboration of different international legal instruments . But what we definitely should avoid and that applies to this group and other international fora , we should avoid applying double standards . Now , about the fact that the mandate of the group and the understandings and the guidelines that were preferred play no role if we only talk about fully lethal autonomous systems . Well , we do not agree at all to such a presentation of the situation . If you read once again the conclusions and recommendations made by this group , you will see that the guiding principles and the conclusions are still fully relevant and they are aimed at preventing certain risks related to lethal autonomous weapons systems . And I would like to say once again , there is no such thing as a fully autonomous system or semi-autonomous weapon system . Autonomy is an objective category that exists . It is definitive . It either exists or it does not . And if autonomy does not exist , then we simply can not have semi-autonomy . In that case , we will be talking about automated systems . Thank you .",Eastern European States,Yes
UNITED STATES,11:35:38,2024-03-05,0:07:19,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . First , just want to appreciate your efforts to guide us in a very good and interactive discussion and appreciate how colleagues are engaging very substantively in a detailed way . This is exactly the kind of work that we need to do . One general comment to react to some of this very good discussion is to recall that what the GGE has already recognized , that autonomy is a spectrum . And because it is a continuum , it can be very difficult to draw a sharp distinction between fully autonomous systems and partially autonomous systems . And drawing different levels of autonomy can also be a bit arbitrary in terms of these kind of categorizations . And I think that is one of the reasons why the GGE has not in its past discussions found consensus on various levels or this distinction between partially or fully autonomous that some are advocating for . I think an important consideration to the US Delegation is that we do not want to overly narrow the scope of our discussion . We want a more inclusive discussion to make sure that this instrument can be very effective and relevant and not to artificially narrow the scope of our instrument and our work in ways that would be unhelpful and make our instrument less effective . I do think there is some divergent views about the term fully autonomous systems . Of course , some Delegations are arguing that fully autonomous systems are unlawful or do not yet exist . I think under our own terminology , we do have autonomous systems that are fully autonomous that we think that we and other states do have and we think these are lawful systems . So I think we do need to do more work to try and reach consensus on common understandings of what we are talking about . I think in relation to this point , I think we wanted to agree with the theme that we heard from our Austrian colleagues that really we should not be doing the normative work of prohibitions here in the context of definitions and characteristics . I think our perspective is that using this definition , this working definition or characteristics , you know , we should use this work to build our common understandings of what we are talking about and then later as we discuss what is prohibited or regulated , I think that is where we can start to do normative work and define well , this is prohibited under existing IHL or this should be prohibited . So really did want to echo that theme from Austrian colleagues that , you know , this is important work that we can do , but we can also really shift and start to work on some of the other elements without reaching firm conclusions on this aspect as well . One more general reaction I will share just with regard to this question and then the next guiding question you have under topic 1 , and we were trying to understand , Chair , better your thinking about how this question is different from the prior elements , the first question that we worked on . Our Delegation had a general reaction that this question here as well as the next question are really sub elements of the first question that we worked on , the overarching characterization or definition . So what we saw here on the page in front of us , the text on the screen is a building block or an element of the first question , and , of course , we support you in trying to make sure we have common understandings of the basic concepts and think this could be very fruitful work , but we could also see this as in some way subsidiary to reaching consensus on the first question . Now just a few reactions to the specific text that you proposed . First with regard to the chapeau , you do have the phrase "" that would be autonomous , "" and we were puzzling over this slightly . We see autonomy as a capability and we would prefer to be more descriptive . To our ear , the words "" would be "" implies some kind of condition or potentiality . They would be autonomous if some condition is satisfied but no condition is given . So I think we would recommend referring to revising the chapeau language so that it would read "" the functions and laws that can be performed autonomously by the laws are . "" So something that is more descriptive rather than potential as you framed it . Regarding the first bullet , we have discussed the notion of critical functions in the past . ICRC I think and others have proposed this . The GGE has not found consensus on it . Our concern with the framing of critical functions is that this category is unclear and unnecessary . We would prefer to move straight to the specific functions in question rather than saying there is this category of critical functions and then we are going to define those sub-elements . I think the sub-element that we would move to and recommend that the group focus on is identifying , selecting , or engaging . That is the particular bullet where the GGE has found consensus in the past and emphasis on identification , selection , engagement of targets as among the essential characteristics that are of interest to the group . From our perspective , it should be an "" and "" rather than an "" or "" because these are components of the system . If the system is merely just identifying targets but not engaging these other functions like engagement , then it might not even be a weapon . So we would focus on identifying , selecting , and engaging targets . And that is it for this question . I thank you , Mr. Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
PHILIPPINES,11:43:55,2024-03-05,0:01:01,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . So our Delegation's understanding is this exercise we are currently conducting is to create a working definition and characterization of weapon systems covered or will be covered by our discussions to serve as the basis of and will be directly connected to later discussions on prohibitions and regulations . So in this regard , as a response to the question you have presented and as indicated in the draft protocol 6 , we submitted along with the G15 . So for us autonomous weapon systems refers to weapon systems that incorporate autonomy in critical functions of selecting , targeting , engaging and applying force to targets . Thank you , Mr. Chair . And as I explained earlier , we see question 2 and 3 very much related to question 1 . So I would now like to move to question number 3 , if you could put that on the screen .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
BRAZIL,11:45:22,2024-03-05,0:01:52,"I just wanted to quickly intervene in this debate about the issue of autonomy in reaction to some of the ideas that we heard here . I think that in our response to the guiding questions we indicated that autonomy , our discussion on autonomy like my colleague from the Philippines , we believe that it should be focused on critical functions and the critical functions are of course critical to the main purpose of this group which is to ensure compliance with the IHL . It would be not it would not be helpful if we expanded the scope to include functions that are not critical , such as , for example , navigation or in the case of aerial autonomous systems , takeoff , landing and mission adaptation . I think that this question could be perhaps reformulated to focus on the critical aspects that are related in particular to another concept that is crucial to our work which is human control . So contrary to what my distinguished colleague from the US said , I think that the critical aspect needs to be emphasized here , otherwise we lose focus on what the important element is . I would also like to add my voice to those who have said that it would be counterproductive to limit our discussions to fully autonomous systems . This has long been the understanding of this group that we are working that autonomy works in a spectrum and that the issue of control is essential . If we are talking about fully autonomous systems , then the issue of control is moot . So I do believe that we should not redefine the scope in this manner . Thank you , Mr. Chair . Thank you for your intervention .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
NETHERLANDS,11:47:48,2024-03-05,0:01:47,"Mr. Chair , thank you for giving me the floor . Let me emphasize that I speak on behalf of the Dutch national Delegation . My Delegation would like to make some comments about the concept of autonomy . We agree with the Distinguished Representative of the United States that we should not necessarily narrow down our discussion and that autonomy exists on the spectrum . For a long time , automation has been integrated into weapon systems . A common definition of automation is the ability of a system to perform a given task without human intervention . Classical automation is rule based and usually there is a deterministic relation between the input the system receives and the output that it generates . Such systems are relatively predictable , but with the introduction of new technology such as artificial intelligence , systems can become goal oriented and self - directed instead of rule based and deterministic . Usually such goal oriented and self - directed systems are referred to with the term autonomous instead of automated , but we believe that both automated and autonomous systems can be placed on the spectrum of autonomy and as such , both automated and automated autonomous systems are the subject of our discussions . There is , of course , a difference between systems in the sense that more autonomous systems warrant different measures to maintain human judgment and control in order to use such systems in compliance with international law , but that is for a later discussion . Thank you , Mr. Chair . Thank you for clarifying your position . Are there any more requests for the floor still on slide number 2 or are we moving now to slide number 3 ?",Western European and other States,Yes
UNITED KINGDOM,11:49:55,2024-03-05,0:02:22,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . Mr. Chair , we note that this room is a group of government experts , so we thought we might just add a little bit of a point that comes from the wider expertise that hopefully we are able to bring into this room , noting that the UK defines autonomy in our defense AI strategy and it notes in particular that autonomy is a spectrum . It is a spectrum that runs from obviously human operated through operator assistance which is a system which assists the operator , task autonomy where systems can carry out operator initiated preset tasks independently , conditional autonomy , operator selects the action to be carried out under supervision in specific conditions and high autonomy where systems make independent decisions within human defined goals . Mr. Chair , we think that maybe the issue here is that we are not talking everybody in this room is not talking about autonomy as a property . It is not a technology as such . Autonomy is a property that a particular system has . We agree that there needs to be it is actually difficult to have categories of autonomy and defining them in critical functions because we also agree to the extent that we are describing something upon which we need to base our discussions here , we need to avoid , and this is the point that we made yesterday , we need to avoid value judgments about what it is that we are describing because that will come later in this conversation and we will continue to have that conversation right up until we articulate the measures that we are looking at . What this is about is describing the picture upon which we are basing that conversation . So attempts to define out certain types of function or certain types of systems is unhelpful for this particular conversation and , therefore , we would remain of the view that it is difficult to have categories of critical functions . Those are the things that you can deal with when you speak about the regulatory function . Thank you , Mr. Chair . Thank you for sharing your views and this was indeed on the third slide on the autonomy question .",Western European and other States,Yes
EL SALVADOR,11:52:35,2024-03-05,0:01:31,"Thank you , Chair , for giving me the floor . Once again , I would like to convey my Delegation's appreciation for the work you have done in preparing this proposal on autonomy . Here I would like to refer to something I said during my previous statement on the levels of autonomy and that is that for us , for my Delegation , it is important to take into account all the critical notions in order to determine autonomy . In other words , my Delegation believes that full autonomy in this area could be the one found in all critical functions of the laws for us , as I mentioned previously , our selection , selecting targets , involvement and the application of force . Also , for us , it is important to be clear about this , about the characterization of autonomy when determining what the approach will be when the autonomy exists in either one or several of these critical functions and that is important because it will prove to be useful when the time comes to set up the regulations and the prohibitions of these weapons when do not meet the standards of international law including international humanitarian law as well as some of the other approaches that we have addressed previously in this Forum . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
PAKISTAN,11:54:20,2024-03-05,0:04:07,"Thank you , Chair . We also would like to join others who have outlined at this point in time that the purpose of our exercise right now is to outline our field , the parameters of our field and to outline the canvas on which we would be painting the regulations or possible prohibitions later on in the exercise . So in that context , it is important for us , for our Delegation as well , to ensure that we are as inclusive as possible in terms of those weapon systems which we would like to address in this GGE . So when we talk about the autonomy , our understanding has also been throughout this GGE that while autonomy is a spectrum , of course , this understanding has been referred to by various Delegations in different manners . In certain cases , human guidance or human - operated guidance in certain semi-autonomous cases is required . Then in those cases , they have always been referred to as automated systems as well in the past . But rest assured , our understanding is that we have always been describing the same cases of those weapon systems . So at this juncture , when we are just outlining the autonomy and the degree of autonomy , I think here we should be as inclusive as possible in terms of the degree of autonomy in these weapon systems . Then on the question of functions , we are of the view that whenever we have talked about the challenges in terms of compliance with international humanitarian law or other challenges , they stem from incorporation of autonomy in the critical functions , namely selection and engagement of targets . Those are the critical functions . Why ? In our view , because those are the places in the stages of the weapon system where decision - making processes are being undertaken , where certain important principles related to IHL , for instance , distinction , proportionality , necessity , they need to be adhered to . So in that case , it is important that we list those functions as critical as long as we are defining them . I think there could be clarity and convergence on this point . But it is important to distinguish them from other functions of the weapon systems as my distinguished colleague from Brazil has said , like navigation , damage repair assessment , communication , which may be autonomous but are not the primary concern at this stage on this issue . Then lastly , on the bullets that you have presented under question 2 , I think identification , selection and engagement at this point in time are useful terms . However , on the discussion whether we should be using or and , our only concern at this point in time would be that we would not want to be in a situation where if autonomy is incorporated , let's say in selection and engagement of functions , but in order due to some human guidance or other intervention , the detection phase is not as autonomous as others , then that system would not be included in our discussions . So with that in mind , we would like to leave this question of whether we should be using sequential or cumulative , this order of functions . I think it would largely depend on what follows and what kind of conversations take place when we go to prohibitions and regulations . Thank you .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
CHINA,11:58:40,2024-03-05,0:04:44,"Thank you , Mr. Chairman . Regarding the discussion on autonomous , it is a key to achieve the definition on laws and it is meaningful . Regarding autonomous , we have five considerations . First of all , we must take into consideration of the weapon systems and the human factor . These considerations are all important . Many colleagues have shared their views just now which are very helpful for us to clarify the scope of laws . At the same time , China believes that the environment where weapons are used cannot be overlooked . Regarding the discussion on autonomous , it must be based on the consideration of three factors which are the weapon systems , human factor and environment . The description of autonomous should also reflect the three factors to be more accurate . Over the time , the distinction between autonomous and automatic has been an issue that we cannot avoid when it comes to the definition of laws . Automation puts the emphasis on defined environment , defined tasks , defined processes or procedures as well as defined outcome . Automatic system has already been a very mature technology in the industrial area . Autonomous , however , puts the emphasis on the capability that is emerged in an open , unknown or uncertain environment . In particular , considering that AI is developing very rapidly , the self - learning capabilities that develops very quickly is even more prominent . When we consider autonomous , this should be taken into consideration . China has also noted that other Delegations have offered similar views . We might want to continue to explore those views . Third , when it comes to the use of autonomous in weapon systems , they can have different consequences when used in different stages . When it comes to autonomous in laws , the focus should more be put on killing chain . If the autonomous nature is not used in the killing chain , for example , autonomous is only used for intelligence information collection or reconnaissance . In these cases , even if the level of autonomous is very high , it is unlikely to lead to humanitarian concerns . Fourth , in order to deepen the understanding of countries , in particular developing countries , of related technologies , we would like to suggest that further discussion be made at the GGE on the distinction between autonomous weapon , automatic weapon and weapons using remote control . Fifth , when it comes to concrete measures that can be adopted in the future , would it be necessary to further distinguish the differences between offensive autonomous weapon and defensive autonomous weapons as well as the differences between anti-equipment autonomous weapon and anti-personal autonomous weapons ? This might deserve our further consideration . Thank you , Mr. Chairman .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
GERMANY,12:03:40,2024-03-05,0:01:17,"Mr. Chairman , Germany views that autonomy is generally associated with self - governance or self - determination . We could also accept the term self - sufficient that is mentioned on the screen . Autonomy can relate to an entire system but autonomy can also relate to certain functions , eg , critical functions , like the process of selecting and engaging a target . We find it important to differentiate between fully and partially autonomous weapons systems or the two tiers . In general , autonomy is absolute . Therefore , autonomy without further explanation is understood as full autonomy . Therefore , fully autonomous weapons systems or lethal weapons systems would perform complex actions , learn and decisively formulate new rules if necessary without human validation . They would operate completely outside human control . By contrast , partially autonomous systems are not autonomous in the proper sense since their framework of action is determined by the human programmer . The margin of scope of action is confined to the selection amongst different options of action preprogrammed or at least in case of learning systems set by the human operator . Thank you . Thank you to the German Delegation for their views . I am now looking around the room whether there are any further requests for the floor with regard to topic number 1 , question number 3 on autonomy .",Western European and other States,Yes
SWITZERLAND,12:05:20,2024-03-05,0:04:55,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . We just have a few observations , a few overall observations at this point . We are following the discussion closely and try to really understand the nuances that we are in now . But broadly speaking , we believe it is really absolutely key that we build on the work so far , build on the agreements that we have had past years . Autonomy is a spectrum , not an either / or and that should guide how we discuss today the points that are on the slide here . We also would join all others who would warn from overly restrictive approaches in general but also at this stage where we are in the debate . We like what the UK said a moment ago that actually what we are doing here is we are painting a picture based on which we then can base the regulation approach . I think the Austrian Delegation made a very good point also that a lot of the things here can be left for later . This is actually some of what we are talking about now . We can address separately further down when we talk about an instrument , when we talk about prohibitions and regulations . On these specific points on the slide , we quite like the Brazilian contribution , the degree in which a system can perform critical functions without human intervention . This picks up the critical functions . This picks up the discussion we had about human intervention . It reflects that it is not black or white . It is not an on and off . It is a differentiation that is needed . We would consider this dimension is really at the core of what we seek to capture in the context of this GG . In a self - sufficient or self - governing manner , these terms to us seem unnecessarily complicated . What if a system is not throughout self - sufficient but only in certain phases ? A hypothetical example , what if another system , a system B , so to say , governs the autonomy of system A ? We should not include overly complicated concepts here . The same applies with the notion about programming sensors and algorithms . That is a good description , good enumeration of things , but here we see the risk that we are looking at this in a cumulative manner . Does it really need to have all these components ? We see , of course , an interest in qualifying the technology , but there is the risk that we may miss some systems that should fall under the instrument that we are talking about here . This is even more the case if we seek to have a characterization that can also stand the test of time . That was said a number of times also yesterday . We need to make sure this can develop with the technology over time . We must make sure that we do not exclude certain aspects , certain technological developments that we might not yet be aware of yet . This is a more general point , again , on the cumulative approach . We are really not quite sure . I think it is a good discussion that we should have this week , notably with the critical functions , whether we really need and , or to what extent engage as such is really the critical point . The others are , of course , also important , but we should maybe also at this stage as a working hypothesis also think of and / or approaches . As I said at the beginning , we are following very closely . These are really good discussions that help us getting clarity , conceptual clarity that is much needed on that point . Thank you so much . Thank you . I would like to pick up on that last remark indeed about conceptual clarity . It is , of course , clear what is our mandate . It is without prejudice to the character . As was stated by a number of Delegations , the normative aspects will have to come later , but there is , of course , still I think a use for having this discussion on definitions and characterizations because once we go to the other part of it later on , because this is if we do not have consensus or at least if we have if we do not have convergent views on what we are talking about , then it becomes difficult to do next steps on that .",Western European and other States,Yes
UNITED STATES,12:13:02,2024-03-05,0:10:11,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . Just wanted to provide my Delegation's reactions on this question , how could autonomy be described or explained ? First , I just wanted to draw colleagues' attention to what I thought was a very good explanation by our colleague from PACS about autonomy . I hope colleagues heard it . It just these and other contributions from civil society really show the value of the GGE as an inclusive process with active participation by civil society , ICRC and others and I thought an excellent point that our colleague from PACS made was that autonomy can be understood as a way of using the system , that we are thinking about autonomy both as a capability that the system has , but it is also a way of using that capability and sometimes you could have a capability that is used one way and it is autonomous but used in another way , it is semi-autonomous or not fully autonomous . I think that is an important idea for us to keep in mind as we are thinking through this issue of how can autonomy be described or explained . In our response to you , Mr. Chair , with regard to this question , we said that in the context of weapon systems , autonomy can refer to the capability of the weapon system to perform various functions without human intervention . It can also refer to the way in which the system is used . In other words , the operator relying on the system to perform those functions without the operator performing them . Another way of putting that idea sort of more in line with the framing of your question , autonomy can be described or explained as a capability of the system and reliance upon that capability by an operator to perform a given function without operator intervention . Autonomy can be described or explained as a capability of a system and reliance upon that capability by an operator to perform a given function without operator intervention . So that is one way of thinking about that idea and trying to capture both dimensions of autonomy , both as a capability and as a way of using the system . Just some very specific reactions now to the bullets that you have assembled under this question . With regard to the first bullet of specific functions of weapon systems , we were struggling a bit to understand that we see autonomy as a general concept that can apply outside the context of weapon systems . So we see this more as a contextual element of this idea rather than as an explanation of what autonomy is . With regard to the second bullet , the capability to perform a given task , I think we would like to be more specific as we are trying to be precise and to sketch out an instrument that we think can guide states' behaviors . We want to be as precise as possible to reflect clear common understandings . So we would add in the notion of a system , the capability of a system to perform a given function . I think our preference would be for function rather than task because that is what our group has focused on and found consensus on is functions in systems . And then this notion of without operator intervention . And here it is similar to task , to language in the next bullet . You know , there's been some discussion is it better to have human intervention or operator intervention . We have tried to explain that we think operator intervention is more clear and we are excluding the possibility of people who are not the operator in question intervening and somehow affecting the operation of the system . From our perspective , the notion of human operator is redundant , right ? We view operator as necessarily meaning human beings and usually in instruments we do not have the word human before every term that refers to a human being , but we just understand that instruments are referring to human beings . I think we are open to hearing more discussions about why people think human is necessary , but from our perspective that is already contained and superfluous to add . I did also want to just respond on the notion of critical functions again in this bullet . We have explained our comment previously , you know , this concept is a bit unclear . We appreciated the response from the Delegation of Brazil . It was very thoughtful and appreciated them trying to explain their thinking . One , I think , initial reaction to that in the spirit of interactivity is that it does not make sense from our perspective to put legal concepts inside the definition . We recommend that the definition or characteristics be as factual as possible so they can be as clear as possible so we know what we are talking about . If critical here means critical to compliance with IHL , then that is a very complex legal idea and , you know , to take the example that Brazil offered navigation , we actually think navigation could be very critical to compliance with IHL . A lot of systems will navigate to a particular area . A system might be used in an area constituting a military objective or certainly munitions can be directed against locations that are military objectives and so in that kind of usage , the notion of navigation which Brazil said would be excluded , you know , actually would be included from our perspective because it is relevant to IHL compliance . I think our perspective is more similar to what we are mentioning , the view that we thought Austrian colleagues were expecting . Let's deal with those substantive issues later but here let's just try and be factual and clear in what kind of systems are under discussion . With regard to the next bullet , subject to different degrees and types of human control , I think you know my Delegation's positions with regard to the terminology of human control , here , you know , we do not think that this is really an explanation of autonomy and , of course , you know , we do not want to endorse the notion that autonomy is necessarily the opposite of control or that autonomy leads to less control . In fact , as we have noted before , autonomous functions can assist the operator in controlling the effects of the weapons system better than without such capabilities . With regard to the next bullet , in a self - sufficient or self - governing manner , here , you know , we did not embrace this terminology . You know , from our perspective , it seemed somewhat inconsistent with our guiding principle of not anthropomorphizing machines . We need to be careful not to say that machines are people , you know , so self - governing to us sounded more like what people do rather than machines . And then lastly , you know , with regard to the last bullet , programming sensors and algorithms , you know , I think as a first note , the antecedent of the word "" its "" in this bullet is somewhat unclear because it does not refer to anything else prior in the sentence . And then , you know , I think we would regard programming sensors and algorithms as technical components , but they do not necessarily explain autonomy . In our view , autonomy is how these components form a capability and how that capability is used . But not necessarily these kind of technical pieces . And then lastly , just with regard to algorithming pardon me , algorithms and programming , we see algorithms as part of programming and so would question why those are set out as distinct . I thank you , Mr. Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
JAPAN,12:23:53,2024-03-05,0:02:45,"I would now like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Japan . Thank you , Mr. Chairperson . I have very brief comments on this because I think the first topic was , you know , first question which we answered we thought should be enough for this subject and the two other questions seems to be subsidiaries for us . But having said that , I want to repeat our basic position on this autonomy . I think for us autonomy , the concept of autonomy is a moving target . So I think our view is that we cannot judge which is the target for the prohibition and which is the target for restrictions based upon the level of autonomy . That is our basic position . Having said that , I heard the today's discussions on autonomy carefully , but I think it is a repetition of the position in the past . And in order to establish a common understanding on autonomy , I agree with what our US colleagues stated , that we need to have more expert contributions , in particular from civil society . In this regard , we appreciate it , the contributions for the discussion . And also , I agree , support what Austria and Switzerland stated , that this topic is a very difficult one . Of course , we welcome the discussion , though . Maybe I think addressing , after addressing the other items , we could get a more clear perspective on how we deal with autonomy . Thank you very much .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
AUSTRALIA,12:26:51,2024-03-05,0:03:51,"Chair , we were very pleased with the substantive nature of yesterday's discussions and would like to reiterate our support for the Chair's approach to providing draft text to frame our discussions . Even our brief discussions yesterday have already highlighted the many areas of convergence between us on these issues . We turn now to the question based on the above explanation or characterization , what functions of laws would be autonomous ? Like Austria and other Delegations that have spoken before me , we find this question a little superfluous . The definition proposed is a function - centered definition . So the functions that would be autonomous based on this definition are those functions listed . We also echo the point made by the US Delegation that autonomy is a capability . The chapeau as drafted reads as if autonomous functions are set in stone . But we know autonomy is a capability and it can be used across different functions and dialed up or down . So the alternate formulation for the chapeau proposed by the US is preferable for us . On the first bullet point which refers to the critical functions of a weapon system , we have observed that there are differing understandings of the meaning of this term . Some use the term critical functions to define a subset of functions . Others use it as an umbrella term for all functions relevant to discussions on laws . Others use it as a shorthand for the functions that would be referred to throughout an instrument . As this term is vague and susceptible to differing interpretations , we would prefer to avoid its inclusion . Turning to the question of how autonomy could be described or explained , like as some other Delegations , Australia does not consider that we should be engaging in normative discussions under this topic , identifying those characteristics that would render a weapon system prohibited . Rather we should be seeking clarity on the broad scope of weapons that we are talking about . We think that the definitional options proposed and discussed yesterday afternoon move us in that direction . We again query the need for a further description or explanation of the meaning of autonomy . We consider this is covered by the definition of laws that we discussed yesterday in the phrase without further intervention by the operator or human operator . On the first bullet point , we would not characterize autonomy as a specific function of a weapon system . Rather , autonomy is a capability that can be incorporated into different functions of weapon systems . With reference to bullet point 3 , we have concerns with using degrees of autonomy as a metric for defining autonomous weapons . As many other Delegations have said , autonomy exists on a spectrum and is not static . On bullet point 4 , we do not consider it helpful to introduce the concept of human control here . It would be more fruitful to have to discuss human involvement and human machine interaction in the context of the application of IHL to laws and in risk mitigation measures . On bullet point 5 , we are concerned that self - sufficient and self - governing are somewhat vague terms that are likely to be subject to differing interpretations and would need further elaboration . On the final bullet point , we prefer a technology - agnostic approach to describing autonomy and weapon systems for the reasons we have previously stated . Thank you , Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,12:30:56,2024-03-05,0:06:27,"Thank you , Distinguished Chair . On the question of autonomy , we agree with several Delegations that took the floor before us about the fact that we do not really need to complicate the discussion of this factor . We think that we had a very productive discussion when we discussed the general definition and the discussion on autonomy . We believe that here in the room , we believe that we are coming closer to a common understanding that the term autonomy is linked to the functioning of the system without any involvement of an operator . The attempts to identify any additional factors simply move us further away from the result that we wish to achieve for different reasons . I also would like to pick up on the idea that was presented by our colleague from the United States following what was said by the representative of PAX . This is a very interesting idea and a very important issue that relates to the relationship between the system , weapon system itself , and the method that is used in connection with this weapon system for the ability to use it in practice . In fact , we are talking about the relationship between the weapon system itself and the technology that is used for the functioning of this weapon system . This is the issue that requires a very serious analysis . My Delegation frequently drew the attention to this question because the technology in itself and the weapon system in itself do not represent any interest for this group because a weapon system that already exists are already regulated by international humanitarian law and international law . Technologies are in themselves neutral . When we link a certain weapon system up with a certain technology , we can face a certain number of new factors that require our analysis . In this respect , what we find important is to carry out an analysis of these factors in the context of the applicability and functioning of existing norms of international law including norms and principles of IHL . This subject related to the relationship between technologies and weapon systems actually sheds the light on the disadvantages of the approach that is based on highlighting certain critical functions , so - called critical functions because in themselves the functions that a weapon system may have , these functions do not represent any new risks in the context of the application of existing international law and existing international humanitarian law . This is why an approach that highlights such critical functions is something that we find to be counterproductive from a legal point of view as we try to define such weapons systems . This is why it is important to try in a definition to ensure a synthesis or synergy between the factors of the categories of weapon systems that will be qualified as lethal autonomous weapon systems . As we said , this may also apply to dual use systems because dual use systems can be lethal and they can be used in order to inflict relevant harm to civilian infrastructure and also to the well - being of human beings . Both of these can be done in a kinetic or non-kinetic fashion . The same applies to the relation between certain factors that relate to emerging technologies that enjoy certain levels of autonomy . This relates directly to the lack of involvement by an operator in this process in order to exert control over such systems . Thank you .",Eastern European States,Yes
LUXEMBOURG,12:37:39,2024-03-05,0:01:12,"We consider that technological autonomy specifically revolves around how a system interacts with its human operator . Autonomy describes the dependence and the relationship between two entities . Therefore , autonomy is essentially concept of the interaction between humans and machines . Consequently , we think defining a system as autonomous solely based on its technical aspects is difficult . The determination of autonomy hinges on the relationship between humans and the system in question . The degree and spectrum of autonomy in critical functions should therefore always be linked to the concept of human intervention which leads us to our main objective , implementing human intervention in order to ensure IHL compliance . To add to the previous discussion on the definition , we highly appreciate the fruitful discussions that we are having right now . As other speakers have already highlighted , a definition gives us a good basis for our work but should not be seen as a necessary presupposition to formulate elements for possible instrument or protocol . Thank you , Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
