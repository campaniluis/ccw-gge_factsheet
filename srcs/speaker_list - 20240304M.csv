I. NAKAMITSU UNDER SECRETARY GENERAL AND HIGH REPRESENTATIVE FOR DISARMAMENT AFFAIRS,10:19:50,2024-03-04,0:05:01,"Excellencies , Distinguished Delegates , I am pleased to extend my greetings to the first session in 2024 of the group of governmental experts on emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapons systems of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons . Let me begin by congratulating Ambassador Robert Indenbroek of Kingdom of the Netherlands for assuming the role of the Chair of the group . I am confident that under his leadership you will be able to accomplish your mandated task of further considering and formulating by consensus a set of elements of an instrument and other possible measures to address emerging technologies in the area of laws . To fulfill this mandate , I urge all of you to build on the past work of the group and on the important convergences already achieved through the several substantive discussions over the past few years . It is now time to overcome the remaining differences . In doing so , it remains imperative for the group to continue to conduct its work in an inclusive manner and take into account the views of all sectors including civil society and to consider the available expertise on legal , military and technological aspects . Distinguished Delegates , last summer the Secretary General presented his new agenda for peace in which he calls on states to conclude by 2024 the sixth multilateral negotiations on the legally binding instrument to prohibit and regulate lethal autonomous weapons systems . This call was reiterated in a joint appeal he issued with the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross . It likewise called upon political leaders to urgently establish new international rules on autonomous weapons systems and stressed that the autonomous targeting of humans by machines is a moral line that we must not cross . I truly believe that the mandate adopted last November by the 2023 meeting of the high contracting parties pays the way for such an international instrument which will effectively prohibit autonomous weapons systems that cannot be used in compliance with international humanitarian law and other applicable law . Clear regulations on all other autonomous weapons systems must also be established before they are developed and deployed in view of the foreseeable risks that they pose to civilians and combatants and the serious concerns they present in the humanitarian , legal , ethical and security spheres . The time to act is now . It is up to you , the states , to take preemptive and preventative approach to shield present and future generations from the consequences of the use of autonomous weapons systems . Distinguished Delegates , I appeal to each and every one of you to make good use of this year's meeting of the GGE to engage in a constructive exchange and dialogue and to work towards achieving consensus on a set of elements of an instrument and other possible measures to address emerging technologies in the area of laws as prescribed by your mandate . Ten years after our first exchanges on the topic , a concrete outcome within this group is urgently needed . You must show that the GGE can achieve concrete substantive progress or risks having decision making on laws , prohibitions and regulations move to other four . You have the power to shape the trajectory of a disarmament goal that will impact generations to come . My office stands ready to support you in reaching this objective . I thank you very much for your attention and I wish you full deliberations .",Non-applicable,No
PAKISTAN,10:27:33,2024-03-04,0:01:51,"Thank you , Chairperson . Thank you for your stewardship of the GGE and your call for cooperative flexible attitude that we fully endorse . We also thank the ISU , the Secretariat , for providing all the support . Referring to this agenda , I was noticing that item 7 is closing of the meeting and in the past GGEs , we have been , this item has been adoption of the report . So we were wondering if the agenda item 7 or the final item ought to be either adoption or consideration of the report because not doing so and just ending up with the closing of the meeting without a reference to the report means that either we are leaving the report writing to next year or beyond or that we will not be considering preparing or drafting the report this year . So we think that there is a need to have a focus on our ultimate product which is the report from the outset and in that sense that would sort of converge our focus towards the goal . So this item could either be if not adoption of the report which it has been in the previous GGEs at least consideration of the report . So this would be our submission at this stage about the agenda of the meeting . Thank you .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,10:33:38,2024-03-04,0:07:52,"Distinguished Chair , we are delighted to see you and all Delegations here at this meeting of the group of governmental experts of state parties to the CCW on lethal autonomous weapon systems . We congratulate you on appointment to this very important and responsible post . You can count on the support and cooperation of the Delegation of the Russian Federation . Chair , the Russian Federation wishes once again within the platforms of the CCW bring the attention of Delegations to the issue of achieving rule 10 of the Rules of Procedure concerning the participation of non-governmental experts and entities including regional intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations . This issue was discussed in detail by state parties during the November 2023 meetings of the state parties , the high contracting parties and also the annual conferences on additional protocol 2 and protocol 5 . However , despite all of the efforts of Delegations and the office , an optimal decision which would suit all and would have allowed us to settle this issue was not found . And so this issue , this problem remains topical today and requires the high contracting parties , the state parties to take decisive action to allow us to emerge from this situation . We confirm that the position of the Russian Federation on this matter has not changed in any way as compared to the position we set forth in November 2023 . As before , our stance is that Chapter 10 of the Rules of Procedure does not provide non-governmental entities by default with the automatic possibility to speak at official plenary meetings in the context of the events and fora of the CCW . Moreover , any activities of such organizations as observers including in submitting working papers and formal documents should strictly be restricted to their competencies and should be aimed at making a constructive and positive contribution to the work of state parties and not to politicize this work . The Russian Federation as other Delegations is interested in the participation of non-governmental entities in the work of the GGE . We consider that their technical and legal expertise could facilitate the group fulfilling its mandate and allow us to come to substantive recommendations and conclusions . Taking account of all of these factors and also the highly technical and expert nature of the GGE , we could propose a compromise , a compromise solution to allow the group to work . We are prepared to confirm the Rules of Procedure of the group of governmental experts as proposed by you , Distinguished Chairperson , only with the understanding that non-governmental entities as identified in Chapter 10 of the Rules of Procedure can be present at the meetings and submit working documents , working papers and speak purely on areas within their competency and in a non-politicized manner , not making any accusations against high contracting parties , state parties . This refers to the working papers and also to their statements made during plenary meetings . If there were any violation of this approach , a decision to agree on the Rules of Procedure would then no longer be valid and would become null and void and they , the Rules of Procedure , that is , would then need and would require to be adopted again , to be confirmed again . This understanding does not create any precedent for the future activities of the GGE and in general all of the fora on the platform of the CCW and is only specific to this particular GGE . We underscore that this is a solution which would purely be valid for the first session of the GGE and would not create any precedent for future events under the Convention . And we consider that seeking an optimal decision to the problem under Chapter 10 of the Rules of Procedure is one that high contracting parties will continue to seek within the session of the GGE and on the margins of the sessions of the GGE and in the intersessional period . Thank you for your attention .",Eastern European States,Yes
AUSTRIA,10:44:17,2024-03-04,0:02:43,"We also wanted to react to this agenda point . Obviously there is a basic understanding from our side that the rules of procedure are already adopted . But it is on the agenda and we have to have this discussion . We are quite happy that there is a compromise on the table or something that we could work on at least . We should definitely move forward , go into the substance and work on this . We should not repeat the discussions that we had in November . The idea by the Russian Federation to basically that all the observers under Chapter 10 would work on substance or would work under their area of expertise , I think this is a given since most of the Delegations , most of the NGOs under this item want to work on substance and have competencies in all this kind of fields . This is definitely true for the ICRC and many other NGOs here in the room . The European Union which also falls under this category definitely wants to work on substance . This is very clear and will have a statement that is relevant . The only problem that we see is that the margin of appreciation on what the way that the Russian Federation has painted it is very wide . And one thing that is extremely important is that this margin of appreciation , what is politicized , what is okay or what is not misused by any Delegation . This is equally important when we move forward with such an understanding . The other point that is also important is that Chapter 10 also includes states and with regard to this group , the observers or others , I think it is really hard and not really possible to limit them to specific competencies and also another state to assess which competencies or possibilities they have on which items they should speak or not . This is simply just not in line how multilateralism works . States even if they are observers in meetings have the right to speak on what they think is important and this could also include political topics . So this part of the understanding that is supposed to be reached in this room is highly difficult and should probably be excluded . But we are still open for moving forward to go to work . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,10:48:10,2024-03-04,0:01:39,"But I think we should refrain from discussion and trying to analyze this in detail . As was said , we also have to be careful if we want to provide politicization that we do not politicize by talking about avoiding politicization . And that is not playing with words . That is a fact , I think . And I think we would all be helped if we would not find it in that way . I think having heard the discussion and with this in mind and with the points raised by the Delegates from the Russian Federation and Austria , I would like to invite the group to confirm the rules of procedure under this agenda item . Russian Federation . Thank you , Distinguished Chair . I am prepared to repeat that we are ready to confirm the rules of procedure as they were approved at the meeting of High Contracting Parties only on the understanding that was mentioned in our statement without any provisos as introduced by the Delegation of Austria . Our stance is that our proposal was submitted for the examination and discussion in the group . If we have a consensus on this proposal on the understanding that we outlined , we would be ready to move on to the substantive work of the group . If such a consensus is not present in this room , then we would prefer to continue discussing this item . We are open to discuss it in the context of this Plenary meeting and also in the context of informal consultations with you , Distinguished Chair , and other interested Delegations . Thank you .",Eastern European States,Yes
AUSTRIA,10:50:44,2024-03-04,0:00:10,"1 . So please take that into account . I would like to underline that that is also in the Rules of Procedure there is this difference indeed . Having reminded Delegations of that the representative We are ready to join consensus on this understanding under the understanding there will be no misuse of this understanding by some Delegations . Yes , I am becoming more and more careful .",Western European and other States,Yes
PAKISTAN,10:57:02,2024-03-04,0:04:12,"Thank you , Mr. Chairperson .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
CUBA,11:01:34,2024-03-04,0:03:22,"The annual meeting of the high contracting parties of the CCW in 2023 agreed on the following mandate for the new Group of Government Experts , GG . In the context of objectives and purpose of the Convention , the group is to further consider and formulate by consensus a set of elements of an instrument without prejudging its nature and other possible measures to address emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapons systems , taking into account the example of existing protocols within the Convention's proposals presented by high contracting parties and other options related to the normative and operational framework on emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapon system , building upon the recommendations and conclusions of the group and bringing in expertise on legal , military and technological aspects , unquote . The current mandate of the GGE is the most ambitious one to date since GGE was first established back in 2016 . The GGE is tasked to work under this ambitious mandate for a period of three years and preferably finish its work by the end of 2025 . The work of the GGE will be taking place in the background of increasing support for negotiating a legally binding instrument . In the policy brief on new Agenda for Peace , the UN Secretary General has also urged states to conclude a legally binding instrument on laws . The GGE will not be starting its work from scratch . As we commence this result oriented and outcome driven process , our mandate demands that we organize our work in a manner that takes into account the following in a comprehensive and holistic manner . Previous work done in building upon the recommendation and conclusion of the group , examples of existing protocols , proposals presented by high contracting parties and other options related to normative and operational framework . Mr. Chair , it has been a long held position of a large number of countries including inter alia members of NAM that issue of laws must be addressed comprehensively in all aspects . The humanitarian , legal , ethical and security dimension must always remain integrated in a meaningful manner in the work of the GGE . The challenges highlighted by various Delegations and the proposals put forward by them address various dimensions . Therefore , it is essential that we organize the work of our GGE in a way which enables us to capture these vital ideas in an integrated manner . Distinguished Chair , in this regard , we believe that the structuring our work around the proposed topics as contained in our indicative timetable is a narrow interpretation of our mandate and we may risk limiting the scope of our work in the GGE . In view of the above , we would like to propose that our work in the GGE may be organized as per the following topics with a clear objective of formulating a set of elements of instruments without prejudging our substantive viewpoints on each of these topics . The topics are one , characterizing , characterization and definitions , application of international law including in particular international humanitarian law , human machine interaction , meaningful human control and ethical consideration , security considerations and other risks , prohibitions and regulations , responsibility and accountability , and finally risk mitigation , confidence building measures and other measures . I thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
PAKISTAN,11:05:02,2024-03-04,0:01:03,"Thank you . We would like to commend you for having been elected to continue the work of the group of experts for a legal framework for laws . My Delegation subscribes to the statement made by Pakistan on behalf of 16 other Delegations . Cuba has constantly called for in its national capacity and as a member of NAM and as representing the signatory countries of the Berne Communiques of the Ibero- American Summit on Laws for an urgent international legally binding instrument on the manufacturing , possession , use of autonomous weapons systems and that this regulate with specific provisions the use of the semi-autonomous weapons including drones . The growing convergence around the prohibitions and regulations on these systems indicates that this must be one of the priorities of the GGG Agenda under the current mandate . Any instrument would revolve around these provisions . For this reason , the prohibitions and regulations should be at the core of our efforts . Our Delegation agrees that we must develop elements surrounding these essential questions with an indicative proposed calendar . However , it must indicate how significant meaningful human control must be an individual standalone item and it is not merely related to IHL or international humanitarian law and the provisions and regulations and the responsibility and accountability among other items . The meaningful human control is the basis of the work that could guarantee compliance international law and international humanitarian law . The ethical perspective which we see in the conscious criteria and other concepts linked to human control must include predictability , traceability , comprehensibility and reliability and other many Delegations have indicated this as part of the future instrument . For this reason , the inclusion of this matter in the indicative program is of vital importance . We would like to underscore also that the indicative calendar in its current form does not allow the high contracting parties to move forward proposing any other item under item 5 . The mandate adopted by the meeting of the high contracting parties last November requires additional well - targeted actions . We believe that these matters are essential for the high contracting parties . The objective of putting together an entirety of elements for an instrument we believe should be the focus of our work at all times .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
COSTA RICA,11:12:22,2024-03-04,0:04:51,"It is a great pleasure for me to see you presiding over our work . I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of a group of countries that have presented a draft protocol 6 and continue to advocate for a legally binding instrument to prohibit and regulate autonomous weapons systems . Colleagues , at the last annual meeting on the high contracting parties of the CCW held in November 2023 , the group of experts agree on a new mandate for a group of experts . This new mandate reflects progress since it instructs the high contracting parties to formulate a set of elements of an instrument taking into account the previous work of the GGE on loss and other examples of existing protocols and other related normative or operational framework . If we interpret this mandate in a light of the call made in October 2023 by the UN Secretary General and the President of the ICRC appealing for a legally binding instrument to prohibit and regulate autonomous weapons systems and we nurture it with the GGE has assembled for more than a decade our discussion looks very promising . We already have considerable foundations to base our work on strengthening by the common elements that have a rising true constructive engagement among Delegations . From the process so far , our group of 15 countries highlights a central point of convergence that recognize that . First , the development , production , possession , acquisition , deployment , transfer or use of autonomous weapons systems under any circumstances should comply with international law including the purpose and principles and rights in the charter of the United Nations international human rights law and international humanitarian law . Second , meaningful human control must be rated to all the whole life cycle of these weapons systems . To ensure compliance with applicable international law , weapons systems that operate detached from meaningful human control are de facto unlawful and ethically questionable . Three , autonomous weapons systems may progressively challenge the faculty of the international community to ensure accountability in the use of force . The international community must reject autonomous weapons systems that hinder the capacity to identify those responsible for international wrongful acts . We encourage , Mr. President , the high contracted parties to keep in mind these common elements while we meet our new mandate as we move on with our work in the GGE . We take this opportunity to recall for the consideration of the GGE that this group of 15 has previously suggested a blueprint on how to operationalize these communities in the form of legally binding instrument with the summation of a draft protocol 6 presented on the second version in May 2023 . The draft protocol positions the need to regulate autonomous weapons systems under obligations that all high contracting parties to the CCW share , the compliance with international law including international humanitarian law and international human rights . The eight articles of the draft protocol develop the key elements that have become recurrent in our discussion on how to consolidate the regulation on AWS , characterization and with this section it deals with the notion on human machine interaction , meaningful human control and ethical considerations , responsibility and accountability . It proceeds then to lay out possible provisions and regulations parameters for legal reviews . It also under calls the importance of the regular provision of capacity building activities covering risk mitigation in developing autonomous weapon systems . Mr. President , colleagues , ours is only one of the multiple proposals presented by high contracting parties available for us to implement this new mandate . There is plenty of work ahead of us . We are looking forward to supporting you and cooperating with all the stakeholders of the CCW so we can carry out our tasks effectively . Let us not delay anymore . Thank you , Mr. President . Thank you . Thank you for your nice words again directed at the Chair but also for staying within the time limit .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
FRANCE,11:17:28,2024-03-04,0:03:21,"The floor is yours . Thank you , sir . Thank you , Chairman . Chairman , dear colleagues , France believes that the best chance of reaching an international framework that is effective and that puts development and the use of autonomous weapon systems within respect for international humanitarian law is to continue to the end the process that has begun here . The Convention on Certain Classical Conventional Weapons remains the correct location to address the legal aspects and other aspects underscored or that have arisen with this emerging technology under laws . This is also the only location in which it is possible to propose universally accepted measures implemented by states that might be developing laws . The work undertaken by the GGE over recent years has allowed us to make collective progress in our understanding of the challenges that arise with potential laws as with the identification of paths that allow us to respond to these challenges . The last session of the GGE allowed for us to underscore the middle ground and that have come of the discussions in this group despite difficulties to move on progress made . These discussions were fruitful . They have shown the common desire of the Delegations to move ahead within this group and under the CCW in order to reach a substantial and meaningful conclusion . We must continue along these lines within our mandate now strengthened . Chairman , France will continue to contribute actively to the work undertaken in the GGE . France has sent along a written response to your request for information on the characterization definition of the implementation of IHL as well as on the measures for risk continuation and confidence building measures . We have also transmitted with six other cosponsors , Germany , Bulgaria , Denmark , Italy , Luxembourg and Norway an on paper on the elements that would go into an instrument two - fold at that that we believe could serve as a basis for our exchanges in order to continue to make meaningful progress and to reach a concrete and substantial result by 2026 or before . We believe that the best way to achieve this is to structure the elements of an instrument according to a two - faceted approach . For France , the ideal approach would be for this instrument to become an additional protocol to the CCW in the framework of the in which the high contracted parties would be committed to fully renounce fully autonomous laws and will address a series of principles that would guide the national development of policies and measures for the implementation of this . This would accompany the development of and use of these weapons systems that are partially autonomous .",Western European and other States,Yes
PHILIPPINES,11:21:03,2024-03-04,0:02:32,"The Philippine Delegation congratulates Ambassador Robert Indenbosh on his assumption of the chairmanship to the group of governmental experts on laws . This is not a walk in the park but the Philippines assures you of its support in constructive engagement towards the substantive outcome . We also appreciate your conduct of informal virtual consultations ahead of the work that we will do this week and the clarifications you have provided in relation to the topics that this group will take on . In line with this , the Philippines associates itself with a statement delivered by the Delegation of Costa Rica on behalf of the group of states that proposed a draft protocol on autonomous weapons system last year . We believe that our work in the coming days should be approached comprehensively and must consider the other dimensions crucial to the completion of the mandate of this GGE . Mr. Chair , there are high expectations among our public on the progress that this group will be able to deliver given that it has been more than a decade since discussions on this topic have commenced . We reiterate the existence of concrete proposals in the past that already highlighted important points of convergence , namely that the roles of humans must remain central to the use of force , the means of methods of warfare are not unlimited and should remain restricted both on the basis of international law taking into account relevant ethical perspectives . Next , we need a set of prohibitions and a set of regulations to govern emerging technologies in the area of autonomous weapons systems . Well , we recognize the incremental progress made in last year's GGE with the addition of elements and concepts that will be integral to the negotiation of an instrument containing measures to prohibit and regulate autonomous weapons systems . The group should firm up its efforts to advance towards the negotiation of a legally binding instrument . The updated version of the draft protocol 6 submitted last year provides a basis upon which the aforementioned instrument could be negotiated . Mr. Chair , as we work towards realizing the ambitious but not impossible mandate of this GGE , the Philippine Delegation will work to support you in ensuring that you will have a substantive report centered around a set of prohibitions and a set of regulations . We will be constructive and flexible and work towards arriving at a consensus and we hope that the same outlook will prevail among the Delegations . Thank you , Mr. Chair .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
STATE OF PALESTINE,11:23:51,2024-03-04,0:03:09,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . Since it is the first time I am taking the floor during this session , I would like to start by congratulating you for your election and assuring you of my Delegation's full support . Mr. Chair , as we enter this new GGE cycle , we should be acutely aware of the credibility problem we are facing and take urgent measures to rectify this situation before it is too late should we want to safeguard the relevance of this forum . If we fail to come up with a concrete outcome , it should come as no surprise that more efficient avenues to regulate autonomous weapons systems will be sought . During the last GGE cycle , the State of Palestine submitted a working paper containing a detailed proposal for the normative and operational framework on autonomous weapons systems . Our position since then has not changed . Mr. Chair , while we are only at day one of this new cycle , we should not feel complacent with time . Advances in technology are outpacing our discussions and have done so for the past ten years . As we speak , the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning software to control the critical functions of selecting and applying force in weapons systems is being increasingly developed , explored and used . Over the past GGE sessions , we raised specific concerns regarding the potential for AI - powered systems being used to commit or accelerate war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide and of them being tested on populations of the global south . For this reason , among others , we called for a legally binding instrument to be elaborated as a matter of urgency and particularly to prohibit any autonomous weapon systems that would be designed to target humans . We are now seeing the direct consequences of the failure to establish new international rules and I am not speaking in hypothetical terms but will instead briefly give a real life example from my own country , Palestine . Over the past five months , Israel has been engaged in the most sustained and intense bombing campaign of a populated area in history in Gaza . More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed including over 13,000 children and Israel now stands accused of the commission of the crime of genocide at the International Court of Justice . We need to ask ourselves what led to such a staggering death tall . An investigation by Israeli plus 972 magazine and local call has revealed that Israel's use of artificial intelligence has been central to the execution of its mass killings in Gaza . The investigation was based on conversations with seven current and former members of Israel's intelligence community , data and documentation from Gaza and official statements by the Israeli army spokesperson and other Israeli state institutions . So let us besiege Delegates in this room once again . First , give priority and more weight to the voices of those states that are or are likely to become victims of autonomous weapon systems . Second , when thinking about the risks of autonomous weapon systems , remember the real life case of Gaza . Third and perhaps most important , insist on the necessity for a moratorium to be imposed immediately on the development of these systems until specific safeguards are agreed in our discussions . Mr. Chair , we look forward to working constructively with all colleagues throughout this cycle and I thank you .",Non-applicable,Yes
NEW ZEALAND,11:27:15,2024-03-04,0:02:09,"Thank you , Chair . Please let me extend our appreciation to you for taking up the role of Chair . You can count on the full support of my Delegation as you conduct your duties this week . New Zealand has a consistent approach to autonomous weapon systems . Our long standing position supporting their prohibition and regulation was recently reconfirmed by our new government . We are pleased to see convergence for support for a two - tier approach last year as reflected in the GGE's report . Our ambition is for a new specific prohibition on weapons that cannot operate in compliance with IHL including those with effects that cannot be anticipated or controlled . And for those that can , we seek a set of regulations or positive obligations . Relevant ethical concerns should be duly reflected . A two - tier approach provides a suitable basis for this group to get a head start in fulfilling our new mandate . In this regard , we recognize that restrictive definitions or characterizations could inadvertently exclude future technology developments . We , therefore , urge a flexible and technology agnostic approach . Technological advancements in the area of autonomy are moving quickly . While we have the floor , we recall last year's UNGA resolution which invites submissions to the UN Secretary General on AWS and we encourage states to engage . We believe this work will compliment that of our group and support progress on this critical issue . We also want to acknowledge the political leadership shown by those countries that continue to hold regional and international conferences and establish initiatives relevant to autonomous weapons systems . These events have helped to create momentum and provide a platform for further discussions on these important issues . This has been highly encouraging . While we continue to hold the view that voluntary initiatives are not a substitute for new rules and limits on AWS , they have a role to play . I thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
IRELAND,11:29:39,2024-03-04,0:03:07,"Let me congratulate you , Ambassador , for assuming your role as Chair and at the outset I can assure you of Ireland's full support and cooperation . For years the GGE has provided a space for a thorough consideration of the risks and challenges posed by autonomous weapons systems and for the development of common understandings . However , as we enter its eighth year , there is an urgency to convert our substantive discussions into a concrete outcome . We no longer have the luxury of repeating theoretical debates of earlier years . We should pick up where we left off drawing on years of constructive engagement and cross regional cooperation as well as the invaluable contributions of the ICRC , UNIDIR , civil society and academia . We add our voice to those of the Delegations that are calling for an outcome oriented discussion this year with a focus on producing a textual document containing elements of an instrument to prohibit and regulate autonomous weapons systems . Chair , the various complimentary initiatives developing outside the GGE should provide impetus to our work here . Ireland was pleased to participate at the recent Manila Regional Conference and looks forward to the outcomes of the Vienna and Freetown Conferences . Ireland was also pleased to cosponsor the Austrian led First Committee Resolution and we call on all Delegations to contribute to the Secretary General's report . Chair , my Delegation believes there is a great degree of convergence that we should seek to build upon and we have an opportunity to explore these areas further . For instance , there is a consensus that international law , in particular the UN charter and IHL as well as ethical perspectives should continue to be the guiding considerations in the work of the group . Indeed , the application of and respect for IHL is paramount and must be placed at the center of our work . We should be able to collectively acknowledge that autonomous weapons systems that cannot be used in accordance with IHL must not be developed , deployed or used . That they are , as others have said , already prohibited . That would act as a constructive starting point . There is also growing consensus with regard to the so - called two - tier approach . Although some of the proposals differ in language or emphasis , the majority recognize that this two - tier approach offers a practical structure that would help to fulfill this group's mandate . My Delegation also hopes to further develop common understanding with regard to the human element in the use of force . It is encouraging that the majority of Delegations recognize that human beings must retain control over decisions with regard to the use of force , that human beings must exert control over the application of force and that there is clear accountability and responsibility for any decision to use force . A future where the decision to take a human life is designated to a machine is not consistent with international laws , norms or values that we have collectively developed . This week it is imperative that we focus on specific issues as well as the proposed rules and measures that Delegations put forward . Your indicative timetable gives us an opportunity to undertake that exercise in a structured manner . However , we believe some important topics such as human control and ethics could be more pronounced within the work plan . We call on all Delegations to support targeted discussions this week with a clear objective of formulating a set of elements of an instrument . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
JAPAN,11:33:00,2024-03-04,0:03:14,"Thank you , Mr. Chairperson . Allow me to begin by congratulating you on your assumption of the Chairmanship Chairpersonship this year and extend our thanks to you and your team including the ISU for the efforts in organizing this meeting . Please be assured of my Delegation's full support . The international community's interest in the military use of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies continues to grow which has made our discussions on laws even more important . The year 2023 saw various related discussions outside of the CCW all based upon decades of deliberations within this GGE . We hope that these discussions outside of the CCW will further enrich the GGE as it continues to be the central framework for the international rule making efforts to develop a clear and effective normative and operational framework for laws . Japan will continue to participate actively and constructively in the GGE . Despite the complexity surrounding the topics of laws and the challenging environment , security environment in which these discussions have taken place in recent years , it is a significant achievement that the GGE was able to adopt the substantive report last year which sets out the two - tier approach concept of prohibitions and regulations based on international humanitarian law . On the other hand , there are some near consensus issues that could not be reflected in the report due to lack of time such as human machine interactions , accountability , risk mitigation and confidence building measures , et cetera . Japan considers that language on these issues from last year's draft report should serve as a good basis for further discussions to build consensus . The GGE now has a three - year mandate through to 2026 . Looking ahead to the seventh review conference , it is important to steadily build consensus each year . Therefore , Japan looks forward to engaging the works on the topics proposed by the Chair for this session of GGE . Mr. Chair , finally , Japan believes that if we can steadily proceed with in - depth and constructive discussions on substantive matters , we will naturally see what the form of the outcome should be . Thus , we should now focus on substantive discussions . Thank you .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
SWEDEN,11:36:29,2024-03-04,0:02:12,"I give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Sweden . Let me begin by expressing Sweden's appreciation for your constructive leadership and the ambitious approach that you and your team have undertaken in preparation of this first session . You can rest assured that Sweden will continue to support you in the work ahead . Chair , Sweden recognizes the encouraging progress that has been made within the framework of the GGE last year where both sessions showed promising signs of convergence on several topics . We appreciate the constructive approach taken by many Delegations in finding common solutions and ways forward including by submitting working papers and organizing conferences to facilitate discussions . Our joint efforts are allowing us to move forward in the right direction , bridging gaps and increasing understanding . By agreeing on a new two - year mandate for the GGE , we believe there is a clear path to a substantial breakthrough if we all show political will . Chair , Sweden supports the two - tier approach indicating that a distinction should be made between those weapons systems that cannot be used in accordance with international law , in particular IHL and systems that include autonomous features which should be regulated in order to ensure compliance with IHL and other applicable international law . We are pleased to see that the approach has continued to gain traction and is contributing to achieving greater progress on issues related to laws . In closing , Sweden believes that the CCW remains the appropriate international forum to deal with issues related to laws allowing for all relevant stakeholders to be part of the process and we welcome the valuable contribution of academia , think thanks and the civil society . We regret that the GGE recommendation to the high contracting parties of the CCW allowing for the GGE laws to meet for 20 days during 2024 was not adopted and is vital to use the days we have to achieve progress and agree on ambitious report in 2025 . We look forward to a week of open , inclusive and productive discussions and harnessing the current momentum . Thank you , Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
AUSTRALIA,11:39:00,2024-03-04,0:02:13,"Thank you very much , Chair . Allow me to congratulate you on assuming your role as Chair of this law's GGE . We also express our appreciation to you and your team and to the Secretariat for the preparations and consultations leading up to this session . You have the full support of my Delegation . We welcome the new mandate of this group which is to further consider and formulate a set of measures sorry , a set of elements of an instrument without prejudging its nature to address laws . This mandate implores us to pursue a technical and interactive discussion building on the very productive discussions we had last year . In line with the remarks made by the UN Undersecretary and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs and several Delegations before me , it is incumbent on us to redouble the intensity and urgency with which we approach this work . Collectively , this group has already generated a large number and breadth of concrete proposals from proposals for legally binding instruments to other options such as the draft Article's proposal which Australia co-sponsored together with Canada , Japan , Poland , Republic of Korea , UK and the United States . While there remain some divergences in what form any instrument or measures should take , we believe there are significant commonalities in terms of substance addressed by the various proposals . Our task as you pointed out is to identify and further advance these commonalities and work through our remaining differences in order to fulfill our mandate . That is certainly the spirit with which my Delegation will approach this GGE session . We would like to acknowledge the two most recent proposals submitted by a group of states and by Brazil . We look forward to studying these proposals in further detail and offering comments this week . My Delegation also takes this opportunity to recognize the invaluable contributions made by UN entities , international and regional organizations , the International Committee of the Red Cross and NGOs to this GGE process . We therefore look forward to these technical discussions proceeding in an inclusive format . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
COSTA RICA,11:41:24,2024-03-04,0:03:18,"I thank you for giving me the floor and I would like to reiterate the support of my Delegation to your work . We would like to call upon all high contracting parties to move ahead in this phase with political will and transparency in the current context . We cannot fail in this task . When this conversation began , sir , many years ago , the urgency revolved around the need to prevent the use of these weapons systems . However , we have now found ourselves moving with the urgency of preventing these weapons systems from being used without any regulation whatsoever . Today , while the use of these systems becomes ever more frequent , the reality compels us to think not merely of prevention but also in the urgency to establish measures for containment . In this context , any result that is not in step with concrete action to restrict the open production , sale , circulation and use of laws will only allow for the conflicts already underway to become more acute and that is at a minimum . For this reason , Chair , there is a clear need to prohibit and regulate these laws through a legally binding instrument . It is with this interest that my country would like to contribute its perspectives to this general debate . Given the wide array of implications that come with the incorporation of AI and new technology , security technology , we would like to reiterate that it is essential that if we do not bring together that the issue of laws must be addressed in a multidisciplinary manner that addresses human rights protection , international criminal law , the obligations within the UN charter , the general principles of international law and ethical considerations that would allow for us to prohibit or limit the use , development , transfer of these systems . This multidisciplinary approach would allow for us to reduce or mitigate risks such as programs and software that develops , that makes those traditionally vulnerable more vulnerable but also this allows us to address the matter from different angles that would allow for a regulation of the acquisition of these laws by private actors such as private security companies or non-state actors , even worse such as terrorists or organized crime . For this reason Costa Rica is greatly interested in promoting this comprehensive approach year after but in my country's commitment to a legally binding instrument has been consolidated . We continue the support continues to grow within the international community . That is essential . I would like to commend the Philippines , Sierra Leone and Austria that have also called us together for meetings .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
URUGUAY,11:44:58,2024-03-04,0:03:46,"Thank you very much , Chairman . First off I should like to commend the Netherlands and you in particular Ambassador Nimbush for having taken on the helm of this GGE addressing laws five years ago . For the past five years I have had the great fortune or misfortune of following this matter closely . It is fascinating and it is worrisome . I believe that I have learned much and suffered much equally over these years of our deliberations . This will be the last time that I participate in a session of the GGE . My post here in Geneva will come to an end in a few weeks . I think that we all agree we are at a defining moment and you have the difficult task of guiding us in this last stretch . As you mentioned this is not the time for general statements but rather what we need is to get to work , roll up our sleeves . The group should focus on a complete mandate considering and bringing by consensus numerous elements that go into an instrument without prejudging its nature and other possible measures to address emerging technologies in the area of laws . I would like to thank all states that presented detailed written responses to the questions . Thank you for the valuable comments and suggestions as this is my last general statement . I would also like to express my appreciation to the civil society for its invaluable work and the work of UNIDIR and the International Committee of the Red Cross throughout this process and in particular my colleagues in the Group 15 which continues to grow . Uruguay believes as would seem to be the general opinion that we do not need to agree on a definition in order to move forward with the regulation of autonomous weapons . There are many examples in the area of disarmament and specifically in this convention . Further for some time now we have had a functional characterization that has been broadly accepted . We believe it is sufficient and adequate particularly given the speed with which AI develops and technology develops bringing about novel aspects of range and autonomy . There is a growing number of states that agree that this instrument should be legally binding particularly in the form of an additional protocol to the convention and that it should not just be tied to lethality . This has been duly assessed . We believe we should focus on the core of the problem . How far can we go in complying with ethics and international law with laws and autonomous systems ? Let us recall that it is not enough to share best practices subject to the goodwill of some states because this would leave out numerous legitimate interested stakeholders and other matters of capital importance . Lastly , Chairman , if you would allow me , it is time to cease to beat a dead horse and move ahead and address these items . Many states are calling for this . And we should take advantage of the precious and scant time that we have for this task . I call for all , I beseech all to work together with constructive spirit to bring about tangible results as quickly as possible . I thank you very much . And I thank you very much for your kind words and for your intervention and for all the work done in the last five years .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
SWITZERLAND,11:49:08,2024-03-04,0:02:31,"I would like to give the floor to the Ambassador of Switzerland . We are delighted to see you presiding over the work of this group and we can assure you of our full support . We also welcome the fact that our group can now base itself on a more robust mandate to examine and to formulate certain elements relating to an instrument without prejudice of its potential final format . And we have three years to fulfill this mandate and different points of view have been expressed on this rather long period of time . My Delegation believes that we need to use this period of time effectively so that we can progressively move towards a robust tangible result as soon as possible whilst seeing progress made every year before our meeting prior to the review conference . We need to straight away focus on formulating the essential elements of a future instrument on lethal autonomous weapon systems and we thank you for the way in which you have proposed we structure our work this week . Characterization , application of IHL , the human factor and different mitigation measures are all essential parts of any future instrument . Whilst we start to examine these elements and how they could fit together in the future instrument we can base ourselves on the work undertaken over recent years , in particular the proposals submitted to our group last year . In particular we wish to highlight that there are several common points between the different proposals even if there are still some differences we need to overcome . These common points are reflected as well in the responses to your guiding questions which are an additional foundation for us as we continue our work . Suggestions on the characterization of lethal autonomous weapon systems are similar in many different submissions and there is a great deal of overlap as concerns the fact that any instrument should have at its core provisions on prohibition and regulation . Opinions are divergent on whether this two - tier approach should be based on the application of international humanitarian law or based on the human factor . It is our view that both elements can coexist . They are not mutually exclusive . Respect of IHL requires human control and these two aspects are intrinsically linked . We are now impatient to dive into work on these questions on the basis of your indicative timetable . Thank you very much , Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
CUBA,11:51:52,2024-03-04,0:02:46,"May I give you the floor ? Thank you , Chairman . In November we commended the High Contracting Parties and the calls from the General from Society and the Secretary General of the International Committee of the Red Cross and others for having seen progress in regards to laws we find ourselves at a critical moment . The recent resolution adopted in the first Committee of the General Assembly of the UN , the numerous initiatives on the national level and regional level to include the conferences in Manila , Costa Rica and that which will take place in Sierra Leone show a clear global interest in the topic . The mandate agreed upon crystallizes the aspirations of the majority to adopt as quickly as possible an instrument that prohibits completely autonomous weapons setting specific regulations for the semi-autonomous weapons . For our Delegation , as has been made clear , the nature of the same should be legally binding . Mr. Chairman , our work did not begin at zero . We have available to us a great many proposals and a growing convergence or agreement around the idea of regular regulations . A more ambitious outcome is within our grasp but we cannot be happy with mere substantive discussions reports and limited output as we see with the guiding principles . We must create elements for an instrument . These should be necessarily aimed at action . They should bring a clear guide to States regarding the limits in place , in force for these weapons . In this group , we should leave behind the development of language that is not conducive to implementation . We do not have many days , Chairman , to bring results for 2025 . Preferably by 2025 , our Delegation believes that we must begin work on the basis of a text as quickly as possible . As this is the first time that the mandate of the group is multi-annual , we do run the risk of drifting into endless debates and complacency . The sense of urgency cannot be lost . Our Delegation will continue with a constructive attitude , this an attitude that allows us to move ahead in an expeditious manner seeking tangible results and meaningful results . I thank you kindly .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
CUBA,11:54:55,2024-03-04,0:03:40,"First of all , I would like to join other than congratulating you on taking over the Chairmanship of this important group . You have the full support of my Delegation . Germany welcomes that the GG on laws will now start to work under its new mandate . The mandate to further consider and formulate by consensus a set of elements of an instrument gives us the opportunity to continue the valuable substantive discussions of this group in a more focused way . In our view , the substantive basis for this assignment has been laid in the past years . A report published last week states that , and I quote , it is increasingly clear that the majority of states agree on certain key elements . We think so , too . In the course of the past years and despite the deplorable blockade of the GGE to consent the final report in some of those years , the areas of substantial convergence have been growing . First of all , more and more members of the GGE have the view that prohibitions and regulations are needed to ensure that international law , including international humanitarian law , will be maintained when emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapons systems are being used or developed . Second , we also see broad agreement on the importance of the role of humans in the context of autonomy . There has even been some movement with regard to the most difficult question of the legal nature of an instrument . A growing number of states would by now accept it if the GGE were to consent a legally binding instrument consented within the GGE in order to prohibit fully autonomous weapons . Germany is one of them . We also see room for intensified discussions how to avoid risks and unintended consequences . This lies in the interest of all of us . We , therefore , welcome your decision to focus the upcoming GGE's discussion on risk mitigation and confidence building measures . We highly welcome the focused approach you have chosen , Mr. Chair , and stand ready to do all we can to support you and your efforts . With regard to the working mode of the group under the new mandate , Germany would see great benefit in starting to work on possible text elements as soon as possible . In our view , the group should aim at consenting written elements of an instrument , preferably before the CCE revcon in 2026 . This could finally demonstrate that the GGE is capable not only of very good discussions but that it also is able to deliver . Germany continues to highly value the GGE as a forum for the discussions on laws that includes all relevant stakeholders . We are very happy to be among the cosponsors of the working paper on elements of an instrument based on the two - tier approach that has been introduced by France earlier this morning . We hope it will provide helpful input on how possible elements of an instrument could look like . To conclude , allow me also to inform Delegations and observers about a side event on fixing gender glitches in military AI , mitigating unintended biases and tackling risks which we organized with the support of Canada , Costa Rica , Panama , Mexico . It will take place on Wednesday , 6 March during lunch break . I hope for fruitful discussion this week , discussions that can also have an impact on the national contributions for the report by the UN Secretary General . I thank you , Mr. Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
HOLY SEE,11:58:56,2024-03-04,0:03:21,"In his message for the 2024 World Day of Peace , Pope Francis affirmed that the research on emerging technologies in the areas of so - called lethal autonomous weapons systems including the weaponization of artificial intelligence is a cause for grave ethical concern . As conflicts and divisions continue to affect humanity , there can be no escaping serious ethical questions related to the armament sector . The urgency of this matter is increasing due to the widespread development and use of armed drones including kamikaze and swarming drones . This has led to a lessened perception of the devastation caused and the burden of responsibility for their use resulting in an even more cold and detached approach to the immense tragedy of war . Autonomous weapon systems cannot be held morally responsible subjects . Human beings possess a unique capacity for moral judgment and ethical decision making that cannot be replicated by a complex set of algorithms and their capacity cannot be reduced to programming a machine that however intelligent remains a machine . If operating without any direct human supervision , such systems may make errors in identifying the intended targets due to unidentified biases induced by their self - learning capabilities . Therefore , it is crucial to ensure sufficient , meaningful and consistent human oversight over weapon systems equipped with artificial intelligence functions . Autonomous weapon systems lack the ability to comprehend the consequences of causing excessive or unnecessary suffering engaging in indiscriminate killing or adhering to the principles of humanity . These expressions which are codified in IHL require interpretation , good faith and prudent judgment , all of which are uniquely replaceable human traits . Mr. Chair , the Holy See has been a vocal supporter of negotiation of a legally binding instrument on laws and in the meantime of an immediate moratorium on their development or use . It is increasingly urgent to deliver concrete results given the pace of technological advancement . This is also mindful of the decade of dedicated discussions on laws . As we have been tasked to further consider and formulate the set of elements of an instrument to address the issue of laws , the Holy See encourages full use of this GGE to work specifically on the scope of prohibitions and regulations of weapon systems based on their degrees of autonomy , keeping firmly at the center of our deliberations the fundamental reference to the dignity of the human person . The development of ever more sophisticated weaponry even with the purpose of reducing collateral damage is not a long - lasting solution . War originates in the human hearts . Therefore , the real solution lies in the conversion to a culture of peace that places technological advancement at the service of humanity , of integral human development and of the common good . Thank you , Mr. Chair .",Non-applicable,Yes
LUXEMBOURG,12:02:35,2024-03-04,0:02:52,"We wish also to congratulate you on assuming the chairmanship of this meeting . You can be assured of our full support , sir . President , we are seeing technological progress which is highly rapid and we are seeing a security landscape which is constantly evolving . Given this , my country remains highly concerned about the threat of use and the use of lethal autonomous weapon systems . The international community bears responsibility to make sure that this technology does not have the devastating humanitarian impact that it could have if there is no appropriate regulation which is universally recognized . Luxembourg welcomes the new mandates that we have which gives us some discretion to agree upon an international instrument . Specific proposals could provide a framework to allow us to have an idea of what a future instrument could be to regulate the use of lethal autonomous weapons systems . We hope that this group will be able to build on the many areas of convergence . President , Luxembourg is firmly convinced that any use of lethal autonomous weapons systems must be in conformity with the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law at its distinction , proportionality , and the precautionary principle . It is vital that decisions can be taken in line with these principles for the use of laws . We believe this is highly important for military technology in the future , but throughout the whole life cycle of these systems there must be meaningful human control . We would insist upon that and the implementation of risk mitigation measures . Luxembourg attaches particular importance to the approach which clearly distinguishes between prohibition of those weapons incompatible with IHL and those weapons systems which should be regulated as proposed by the so - called two - tiered approach . The way in which we formulate this approach has met with some divergent views but we do feel it is still the most appropriate way to make progress . We would draw attention to the working paper initiated by France and Germany and cosigned by Luxembourg . This document introduces a highly relevant framework of possible elements of an instrument based on the two - tiered approach so it is important for our work . You can find all of our statements online , sir . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
SOUTH AFRICA,12:05:47,2024-03-04,0:03:09,"The floor is to the Distinguished Representative of South Africa . South Africa congratulates you on your appointment as the 2024 Chair of the Group of Government Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems . Your leadership comes at a critical juncture as we contend with the interaction between emerging military technologies and established international legal norms . This critical moment is further intensified by the shifting geopolitical landscape which further adds layers of complexity and agency to our deliberations . Chairperson , South Africa acknowledges the profound importance of addressing the challenges presented by the lethal autonomous weapons systems within the framework of international security and humanitarian law . As a nation committed to peace , human dignity and the rule of law , we believe it is imperative to confront the ethical , legal and societal implications of these technologies . In line with the principles established by the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and our obligations under international humanitarian law , South Africa reaffirms its position that all weapons , including laws , must be subject to effective human control . We assert and reiterate the decision to take a human life must not be delegated to machines . This control is essential to ensure accountability , compliance with IHL and the protection of civilian populations during armed conflict . As a result , South Africa is of a firm belief that there is a need for development of legally binding instrument that will regulate laws . We believe that such an instrument is necessary to prevent an arms race in autonomous weapons and to ensure that their use is consistent with international legal standards and ethical considerations . We further recognize the complexity of autonomous technologies and their potential to change the nature of warfare . Therefore , we call for a comprehensive approach that includes a clear definition of what constitutes the meaningful human control over laws , provisions to ensure transparency in the development and deployment of laws , machines for international cooperation and verification to prevent an arms race as well as safeguards to ensure that laws cannot be used in a manner that contravenes IHL and international human rights law . Chairperson , at the 78th United Nations General Assembly First Committee , South Africa supported Resolution L56 which emphasized the urgent need for collective action on issues . We commend the UN Secretary General for his efforts to compile a comprehensive report reflecting the diverse views of Member States and observer structures on laws . South Africa maintains that there should be a collective action aimed at ensuring that technology serves humanity's best interests , not its destruction . South Africa stands ready to work with all Member States to forge a consensus on this pressing issue and to strive towards a future where peace and human security are enhanced by technology and not threatened by it . I thank you .",African States,Yes
PERU,12:09:08,2024-03-04,0:03:12,"I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Peru . Thank you . Thank you , Chairman . I should like to begin by commending you for having taken the reins in this important GGE . I would also like to recognize the work of the previous Ambassador Flamengo and I would like to thank you also for the preparatory work that you and your team have undertaken . You will have the full support of the Delegation of Peru . Peru reiterates its concern regarding the urgent need to adopt a Treaty that prohibits and regulates the use of autonomous weapons . In this context , Peru shares the joint call by the Secretary General of the United Nations and the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross . They called for the launching of negotiations on this legally binding instrument as quickly as possible . To this end , we reiterate our position against the development of these weapons without human control . They shoot themselves , driven by AI and based on facial recognition . We are also concerned that autonomous weapons systems can become WMDs and they change the thresholds on the use of deadly force . Given this , we reaffirm our call for the high contracting parties to resolve the differences and reach concrete results . This would lay the groundwork for adopting a legally binding instrument , the instrument we seek , based on IHL . It is in this spirit that Peru endorsed one year ago the Berlin communique as well as the communique of the American Summit and further , Peru cosponsored the resolution adopted at the last session of the General Assembly . It sought to broaden the debate internationally while calling upon states for relevant information on this topic . Chairman , recognizing the value of the progress made to date and reaffirming the need to continue to codify and develop progressive law in international law applicable to armed conflict , Peru , together with another three states , presented a draft protocol on autonomous weapons systems protocol 6 . We believe that that could contribute to our discussions . For all of the aforementioned and recognizing the serious risks and challenges that come with these weapons and the transcendental nature of the mandate of this GGE , we continue to call for a successful week of work here . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
INDIA,12:12:33,2024-03-04,0:03:24,"Mr. President , India congratulates you on your taking over the leadership of this very important process . We have complete faith in you and look forward to working with you . We would also like to record our appreciation of the work of Ambassador Flavio Suarez - D' Amico . I would like to make six points . Number one , my Delegation has noted how you propose to structure the discussions in this new phase of the GGE's work and is able to support your ideas . We have found your guiding questions useful and will provide substantive inputs . Number two , this GGE should build on its previous work . We believe that its accomplishments in generating concepts and a lexicon that captures some of the elusive characteristics of emerging technologies and their impacts are considerable . This needs to be squarely acknowledged , used as a basis for further work , incorporated in the elements of any possible instrument and be a primary focus for the future work of this GGE . Number three , this GGE meets in a new military reality in the midst of armed conflict and war . The military reality is that there appears to be deployment and use on an unprecedented scale of weapons and weapon systems incorporating emerging technologies which impart autonomous characteristics . The military reality also is that further development , deployment and use of such weapons and weapons systems can be anticipated . Given this reality , my Delegation believes more strongly than ever before that the CCW which balances military necessity with the humanitarian imperative is the best platform for discussions on this issue . The discussion of possible prohibitions and restrictions on these emerging technologies as applied to warfare to be credible needs to be connected to this military reality . Number four , we live in a fragmenting world . We have splinter nets behind firewalls . We have fragmented trading and financial systems . My Delegation believes the discussions on the subject of this GGE's mandate should not contribute to a fragmentation of the normative sphere . It is important for all to acknowledge that we inhabit differing security realities . My Delegation believes that the purpose of this GGE and this convention is to find common ground that takes into account the concerns of all . The proceedings of this meeting should not be used to create the ground for generating parallel sets of rules . This would contribute to a further weakening of the multilateral system . India as a matter of principle favors number five , sorry . India as a matter of principle favors legally binding instruments in the sphere of arms control and disarmament . We would , with reference to the mandate of this GGE , like to note that much more work is required before meaningful negotiations can commence on a legally binding instrument . Number six , we have already stated that we can support a politically binding instrument based on the guiding principles . We believe that these guiding principles and previous reports contain a powerful norm that emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapons systems are not exempt from the prohibitions , restrictions and limitations that are contained in international humanitarian law . Thank you , Mr. President .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
BRAZIL,12:16:12,2024-03-04,0:03:34,"Thank you , Mr. Chairman . The full text of my intervention will be made available via electronic means . I congratulate you , Ambassador Indenbosh , for taking up the chairmanship of this GGE . Due to my experience , I might have a good appraisal on how demanding , complex and exacting your challenges will be . Yet I also know that we could not be in better hands as we begin this new and crucial phase of discussions on what is one of the most threatening among emerging technologies . Complex security scenarios coupled with rapid technological change generate a very dangerous mix . The report of the 2023 session represented a fine balance . Consensus outcomes are not perfect outcomes . Some experience frustration , others will try to apply the brakes . A dispassionate view would point that the report offers a sound framework for the future by including two important substantive elements , a common understanding on the two - tier approach based on prohibitions and regulations and the issue of control as a key element for ensuring compliance with international humanitarian law . It is our hope that the GGE will now be able to build from its past achievements and live up to the high expectations of the international community . We now count with a multiyear mandate avoiding the recurrent and difficult exercise of its yearly rediscussing . However , complacency is not an option . We are not to bask in the glory of previous results and squander this opportunity . The neck breaking speed of technological advances is rapidly closing the window of opportunity for regulation . There is a growing debate as to whether the GGE is the right conduit for progress . Yet few doubt the extent of the expertise in this body . But the extent of divergence is not to be minimized . Expertise and divergence in the right doses are the foundation for results that can pass the tests of effectiveness , compliance and universalization . Outcomes failing to address these three criteria will not be serving well the progressive development of international law . Mr. Chairman , I thank you for the preparation of well structured guiding questions . Brazil has submitted its views and is carefully examining the compilation of national responses . We commend the Secretariat for its efforts in putting together this most useful document . Of the three areas you sought our opinion , I will focus on characterization and definitions . This issue can generate endless discussions . A common understanding is desirable but not at the price of procrastinating . Examples derived from CCW protocols and treaties in which technologically neutral formulations were developed are to be taken into account if we were to avoid the pitfalls of excessive precision but also count with enough guardrails . Brazil will carry on with its steadfast commitment to the GGE . It will submit the working paper on the contributions from the 2021 global ontological standards for ethically driven robotics and automation systems from the Institute of Electric and Electronic Engineers . They provide a technical basis for confidence building measures . As a reminder , we will co-host at lunchtime tomorrow with Australian event which does perfectly with this approach . I thank you , Mr. Chairman . I would like to thank my Brazilian colleague for his intervention and also drawing our attention to the side event .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
COLOMBIA,12:20:08,2024-03-04,0:03:33,"Thank you , Chairman . I should like to begin my statement commending you for having been elected to Chair this GGE . I should also like to convey to you the decided support of the Delegation of Colombia to your work .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,12:23:54,2024-03-04,0:03:46,"Distinguished Chair , the Russian Federation considers the Convention on Certain Kinds of Conventional Weapons as the optimal forum for the examination of issues relating to lethal autonomous weapon systems given its unique nature . Moving this issue to any other international forum including within the United Nations would be counterproductive . We draw attention to the fact that the compliance with existing obligations under export control regimes in the context of lethal autonomous weapon systems should be discussed in the relevant export control formats . We greatly value the work of the GGE and the considerable results which have been achieved in this group including the adoption in 2019 of the guiding principles . We welcome the approval by the meeting of high contracting parties to the CCW of a new discussion mandate of the group up until 2026 . The mandate of the group provides for the comprehensive discussion of all of the tasks and issues before it taking account of all previously agreed options by the group of ways in which you could regulate the use and development of laws including taking account of existing IHL without any additional norms . It cannot be reduced just to formulating a set of elements of a legally binding instrument that has already been focused upon by some individual Delegations and in particular it does not provide for negotiations on the development of any particular document . We consider that pursuant to the mandate of the group we will conduct a balanced analysis of all existing norms and principles of international humanitarian law applicable to lethal autonomous weapon systems and that understanding has been reflected in the report of the group of governmental experts of 2022 . It is our premise that the work of the GGE should be conducted fully in line with the goals and purposes of the Convention and should not extend beyond the scope of this . We would note the importance of contracting parties being provided with the required level of expertise and so the further inclusion of representatives of industry and academia in the discussions of topics relating to laws . We would note that the principles of humanity , the dictates of public conscience as well as the human rights component cannot be used as the absolute and sole condition for the introduction of any restrictive or prohibitive regimes on certain kinds of weapons . To conclude , I wish to say that we count upon the group of governmental experts being able to agree taking into account the opinions of all contracting parties on substantive conclusions and recommendations to be presented to the 7th CCW Review Conference .",Eastern European States,Yes
SIERRA LEONE,12:28:00,2024-03-04,0:04:14,"Thank you , Chair . We will deliver our full statement by the electronic means . Sierra Leone aligns itself with the statement delivered on behalf of the group of 15 on the agenda item 5 , general statements . We deliver the statements in our national capacity . Mr. Chair , Sierra Leone continues to advocate for a legally binding instrument to prohibit and regulate autonomous weapons system . There is a going call to finalize negotiation on a legally binding instrument to regulate autonomous weapons system including in joint appeal by the UN Secretary General and the ICRC President for States to negotiate a legally binding instrument by 2026 to prohibit autonomous weapons systems that functions in such a way that their effects cannot be predicted and those with the power and discretion to take lives without human involvement and to set a clear restriction for all those types of autonomous weapons systems . In line with the growing momentum for a new legally binding instrument , this forum at the last annual meeting of the high contracting parties of the CCW has agreed on a new mandate to formulate a set of elements on an instrument taking into account the previous work of the GGE on laws and other examples of existing protocols and related nomadic operational framework . This marks a crucial and long awaiting advancement , one that demands our genuine result oriented and inclusive discussion to fulfill our mandate . It is imperative that we seize this opportunity to address the serious challenges associated with autonomous weapons system , especially after prolonged deliberation spanning over a decade . As we lay the groundwork for our mandate infrastructure , we see these our convergence points as fundamental in shaping substantive efforts towards the development of a legally binding instrument . In this regard , we would like to refer to the elements of draft protocol 6 submitted by G15 and call on high contracting parties to engage on this document along with other working papers to arrive at a single set of elements that inform our work and eventual negotiation . It is our view that the new mandate should focus on incorporating elements of characterization with emphasis on human - machine interaction , meaningful human control , ethical consideration , prohibition , regulation , weapon review , risk mitigation and compliance . Mr. Chair , we would like to take this opportunity to welcome the political leadership shown by countries who have held or will hold conferences relevant to autonomous weapons system thus far . This endeavor serves as a foundation for ongoing discussions on these crucial matters and contributes to the growing momentum , particularly as we find ourselves at the pivotal juncture . We take inspiration from the inaugural regional conference focused on addressing the peace and security elements of autonomous weapons system in Freetown on April 17th and 18 th , 2024 . We hope this will contribute meaningful to the broader global efforts concerning the regulation and control of such system . Finally , in embracing the pivotal opportunity to build on the momentum achieved , we strongly urge our contracting parties to chart a purposeful course ahead . This entails advancing towards the formulation of a legally binding instrument that effectively addresses the humanitarian and international security challenges presented by emerging technology in the field of autonomous weapons . Mr. Chair , we stand ready to support you and to constructively work with all Delegations to deliver on our new mandate . I thank you .",African States,Yes
GUATEMALA,12:32:35,2024-03-04,0:03:47,"Chairman , thank you for giving me the floor as this is the first time that I speak in this venue . Allow me to offer you an applause for your commitment to this work that lies ahead for the GGE . We have witnessed the efforts aimed at bringing a fruitful and constructive result of the group . We believe firmly that this is one of the most ambitious and important mandates that this GGE has addressed . For this reason , we see this as an opportunity to move forward with concrete steps to show the true will among members to begin negotiation of a legally binding instrument on laws . Guatemala shares positions with numerous groups . It is important to note the NAM and the G15 on repeated occasions . They have reiterated historic position here based on the idea that this should be addressed in a comprehensive manner with the broad mandate we commend or we welcome this in the new agenda for peace of the Secretary General . This means that we should find solutions that allow us to regulate the use of AI in these weapons and the risk that the autonomous nature of these bring to international peace and security . During the 78th session of the General Assembly , Guatemala sponsored with 11 countries the resolution on laws in the first committee on international peace and security . There we reflected a concern over the use of new technologies in the military hands , including AI and autonomy in weapon systems as well as the negative consequences and impact of these on regional and international security , international stability and emerging arms race . I should like to thank the Delegation of Austria for the presentation of this resolution . There is a great concern over the compatibility of these autonomous systems with the existing principles and applicable norms of international law , IHL and the UN charter . As the use and deployment of these would bring significant humanitarian costs and destabilizing factors . This is an opportunity to remember the 11 principles of the group that were adopted by consensus . We focus particularly on the common agreement that international humanitarian law should continue to be implemented to all weapon systems including the development of laws . This brings us to the need to undertake a dialogue to respond to the biggest questions , that is to save criminal responsibility for the misuse of these weapons . We must call for the inclusion of observers in this space that bring technical knowledge and practical knowledge on the misuse of these weapons and that bring us a holistic view of the consequences that we would face if we do not launch a prompt negotiation on these systems . Chairman , Guatemala reiterates that we should bear in mind that said forth in Article 91 of the additional protocol 1 of the Geneva Conventions specifically as refers to responsibility which falls on the parts of the conflict that violated the provisions of the same by members of the armed forces . Hence , current international law provides means to try the people but not the machines . Domestic legislation is still not adopted to the challenges that arise of a possible use of these systems . Hence , Guatemala favors the adoption of a legally binding international instrument that sets forth the same to fill the gaps of criminal liability . For this reason , Chairman , you will have the firm support of Guatemala when it comes to moving ahead in this first session of the group . We are hoping very much for a fruitful week . Thank you very much .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
NORWAY,12:36:42,2024-03-04,0:02:25,"Thank you , Chair . Allow me first to express our gratitude to you and the Netherlands for chairing this GGE and facilitating the current discussions . Let me also reiterate the importance that not only states but also international organizations , civil society and other stakeholders contribute to international normative developments , not least the work of this GGE . In view of the mandate to develop a set of elements of an instrument without prejudging its nature , the GGE is best situated to address the substance of those elements . In order to satisfy our mandate , we do well to remember that the elements that the GGE in the end will recommend should also be apt for inclusion in a binding instrument . International engagement on military use of artificial intelligence , including laws , is growing . In December , the UN General Assembly took its first action on laws . In order for our efforts under the CCW to remain relevant , this GGE should aim to progress at an accelerated pace and produce recommendations before the end of next year . We should move quickly to substantive issues . Along with several high contracting parties , Norway continues to strongly believe in the usefulness of the two - tier approach . We have therefore taken note of the call of the Secretary General of the United Nations to conclude by 2026 a legally binding instrument to prohibit lethal autonomous weapons systems that function without human control or oversight and which cannot be used in compliance with international humanitarian law . It is quite clear to Norway that international law , and in particular humanitarian law , already prescribes limits on the employment of autonomous weapons systems . The elements of an instrument to be elaborated by this GGE should contribute to clarifying those limits . In order to heed the call of the Secretary General , they should be clarified in a manner suitable for inclusion in a legally binding instrument . Together with Bulgaria , Denmark , France , Germany , Italy and Luxembourg , we have submitted a working paper on elements of an instrument that we believe can facilitate substantive discussion on the basis of a two - tier approach . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
UNITED STATES,12:39:20,2024-03-04,0:02:38,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . We would like to begin by congratulating you on your selection as Chair of the GGE and to assure you of the full support of the US Delegation . We would also like to thank you and the Secretariat for all the work that has gone into preparing for this meeting and for the work that you have done to engage with Delegations in advance of this session , including through your guiding questions which will help us to hit the ground running . The mandate from the CCW High Contracting Parties provides the GGE with clear guidance on what we must do this week and over the next few years leading up to the 7th Review Conference . We have time to complete our work , but we all know the complexity of reaching consensus on specific language and we must use our precious time wisely . In our Delegation's view , it is critical that we immediately begin work on our mandate to further consider and formulate by consensus a set of elements of an instrument and other possible measures . As others have recognized , we are not starting from scratch . We have a number of proposals on the table and are building on the foundation of the work of previous years . We are ready to engage in a constructive and substantive way and hope others are ready to do the same . While our work does not take place in a vacuum and we are deeply concerned with the immense suffering caused by the many conflicts around the world , we recognize that the work of this group , a group of governmental experts should be carried out consistent with our role as a technical body of legal , military and policy experts assisted by representatives of nongovernmental organizations and civil society . Mr. Chair , we very much appreciate you organizing our work this week around certain key issues that the GGE has discussed for many years . Although Delegations continue to express significant differences on many issues , the importance of complying with IHL is a foundational premise shared by all . Thus , our Delegation sees working to develop elements that advance our shared understanding of the application of IHL is critical . We also support distinguishing between on the one hand , weapons prohibited from use in all circumstances and on the other hand , regulations for the use of other weapons . In our view , this two - tier approach is a sound approach based on existing IHL and can attract consensus . We also agree that characterization , risk mitigation and confidence building measures are important areas for the GGE's work under our new mandate . Mr. Chair , we again expressed our Delegation's thanks for your efforts thus far and commit to engage in a constructive spirit this week . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
IRAQ,12:42:18,2024-03-04,0:03:48,"Sorry . Thank you , Mr. Chair . We congratulate you on assuming the Chairmanship of the GGE on laws and we assure you of our full support . We also wish to thank the permanent representative of Brazil for his efforts when he was presiding over the work of the GGE last year . We are starting our work this year on the basis of increasing international support for a legally binding international instrument which should allow us to achieve significant headway within the GGE . Our mandate requires us to adopt an ordered approach and to have an exhaustive approach to our work to adopt measures for risk mitigation and also confidence building measures amongst others . The position of many states including Arab states is that this matter must be dealt with in a holistic , comprehensive manner . The human , legal , ethical dimensions and security interests must all be born in mind in the work of the GGE . In this context , Iraq wishes to highlight the following : We accord particular importance to the protection of civilians and the implementation of international law and international humanitarian law and international human rights law in particular . Iraq hopes that we will be able to achieve a consensus on lethal autonomous weapons systems in order to establish clear legal restrictions and prohibitions on their use and the two - tier approach would require us to evaluate these weapons systems from technical , legal and ethical points of view and to shed light on the link between these weapons and others . Developing technology in all spheres of life should be guided by ethics and ethical considerations . Humans must put moral values first as machines cannot do so in an appropriate manner . It is also of great importance that we apply the principle of responsibility and accountability in the use of all lethal autonomous weapons systems . In addition , we should consider the possibility of terrorist groups and armed groups taking possession of these kinds of weapons and focus as well on the possibility of compiling data in this sphere . We very much hope that we will achieve a consensus to have a legally binding instrument . Thank you .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
SRI LANKA,12:46:30,2024-03-04,0:03:11,"I would now like to hand the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Sri Lanka . I congratulate you on assuming the role as the Chair of the group and please be assured of the fullest cooperation and support of my Delegation for the success of our work . Mr. Chair , we are pleased to note that over the past years the mandate of the GGE on laws has evolved in a stronger and positive direction through the extensive deliberations of the group . Today we have before us the most ambitious mandate since the establishment of the GGE entrusted to further consider and formulate by consensus a set of elements of an instrument . With a view to organize the work of the GGE based on the new mandate to be more effective and outcome oriented and furthermore to make the objectives and focus more clearly in formulating a set of elements of an instrument , Sri Lanka supported a joint proposal on the topics for discussion at the first session of the GGE on laws . In our view we should not leave any of the elements unattended in the backdrop of rapidly advanced technologies and automated functions of weapons powered by AI . My Delegation suggests that a set of elements of an instrument should consider application of international law in the broader context to prohibit and regulate autonomous weapon systems including international human rights law , the UN charter and other relevant treaties on arms control beyond the principles of IHL . Characterizations and definitions of laws is another aspect that we need to carefully focus on while considering the level of autonomy , new trends in autonomous functions as well as the development of information systems as data is an important element for AI powered weapon systems . It is essential to consider the functional approach of the lethal and autonomous weapon systems as well as future challenges when characterizing and defining laws . In addition to considering risk mitigation and confidence building , the GGE may also focus on security considerations and other risks in a broader perspective in the prevailing geopolitical context . My Delegation is also concerned about the long - term and severe impact to the environment and health - related risks of laws . It is our firm view that the GGE should also focus on addressing responsibility and accountability of deployment as well as consequences of deployment of lethal and autonomous weapon systems including the breach of IHL . In this regard we need to address the challenges of making non-state actors responsible or accountable for violating IHL in non-international armed conflicts . The lack of directly applicable Treaty laws does not restrict the applicability of customary laws to hold non-state actors , violators accountable . Mr. Chair , while Sri Lanka remains ready to discuss all these parameters , our consistent position remains that non-binding regulations in this area are inadequate given the rapid advances , future trends as well as lethal and unpredictable consequences of the use of laws . We also see the growing number of calls from states for a legally binding instrument . We are mindful that the existing provisions in IHL do not provide answers to all the associated threats of today's sophisticated weapon systems . Therefore Sri Lanka continues to advocate and strongly support negotiations towards a legally binding instrument for prohibition and regulation of lethal autonomous weapon systems . Our full statement will be uploaded on the website . I thank you , Mr. Chair .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
ISRAEL,12:50:00,2024-03-04,0:01:50,"May I remind you , you have two minutes . Thank you . Thank you , Mr. Chair . I exercise the right of reply to the remarks made by the Delegate of the Palestinian Authority which once again exploited this forum for political purposes . Chair , I will be brief and must clarify two points . First , Hamas together with its accomplice , the Islamic Jihad , started this war and continue to attack Israel , hold hostages and are committing war crimes and crimes against humanity . Israel and the IDF act in accordance with international law and make many efforts to mitigate harm to civilians to the maximum extent possible under the circumstances that the terrorist organizations created while fighting an enemy whose core strategy is using its own civilians as human shields . Secondly , as part of the impressive model of fallacies and misinformation , the Palestinian Delegate has succeeded integrating into her brief statement . She also talked about the use of artificial intelligence systems that choose targets in Gaza . But there is nothing between the type of systems we focus on in this forum and her arguments . As a matter of fact , Israel is not using an AI system that autonomously chooses targets for attack without human involvement . The target selection procedure Israel is employing is handled by humans and Israel has been transparent about it . It is worthy , however , to note that the unimaginable 7th of October Hamas atrocities that the Palestinian Delegate forgot to mention were not conducted using autonomous weapon systems . Israel has the right and indeed the obligation to defend its citizens and territory by taking all legitimate measures to secure the release of the hostages and neutralize the threat it is facing . Israel will no longer tolerate living next to this terrorist entity whose goal is to annihilate Israel . I thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
STATE OF PALESTINE,12:52:11,2024-03-04,0:01:43,"As I said before , you have two minutes . Thank you . Thank you , Mr. Chair . I did not intend to take the floor but I am compelled to do so to reply to the allegations of politicization that Israel has made . We wonder which part of our statement exactly could justify an accusation of politicization . Which part of it was not factual ? Has Israel not killed 30,000 Palestinians in Gaza ? Does it not stand accused of the commission of the crime of genocide at the International Court of Justice ? Has there not been an investigation by Israeli plus 972 magazine and local call revealing Israel's use of artificial intelligence to accelerate its commission of mass killings in Gaza ? You say the investigation was wrong . In this regard are you saying that the current and former members of Israel's intelligence community contributed to this investigation and on which the results of this investigation are based relying that what they said is incorrect ? Mr. Chair , if the answer to these questions is no and our Delegation has only made a statement of fact , then we must ask ourselves who is in fact politicizing our discussion in this forum . Where rights of reply are used with the intention to stifle debate , to silence truths that are simply too embarrassing or too inconvenient for a Delegation to hear , then these rights and this very forum are simply being abused and this must be rejected . Let me also bring attention that since making my statement this morning , I have seen an article in Haaretz , the Israeli newspaper entitled Gaza becomes Israel's testing ground for military robots . I encourage everyone in this room to read it . It is absolutely pertinent to our discussion and I thank you .",Non-applicable,Yes
