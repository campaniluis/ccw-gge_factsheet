VENEZUELA (BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF),15:12:35,2024-03-04,0:03:37,"Thank you , Mr. President . The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela would like to welcome you , greet you and thank you for the preparation of the session of the GGE on laws . Our delegation would like to take this opportunity to highlight yet again the close relationship between the Convention and international humanitarian law . It is clear that this link is particularly relevant in the context of laws where the potential for indiscriminate harm and unnecessary suffering is strikingly high . And so the painful situation of international security and the presence gives critical importance to this meeting in light of the goals of the Convention and particularly given the current mandate of the group which focuses on the appeals made to redraft an international regulatory instrument for laws . We agree that this process must begin quickly and should fully include the proposals presented by the high contracting parties and consider the recommendations and conclusions of the group beforehand which have already concluded ten years of in - depth work . With that in mind our delegation would like to take this opportunity to share with the high contracting parties five aspects of fundamental importance to be considered during the implementation of the mandates . First we reiterate the need to guarantee human control of the laws as a cornerstone of any regulatory framework . This principle must be clearly defined in order to avoid interpretations that might jeopardize ethics and security . Secondly we call for the inclusion of a complete ban on the development , production and use of lethal autonomous of laws that operate without human control highlighting the importance of preventing the risk associated with autonomy in the decision taking of lethal actions . This calls for the creation of a legally binding instrument that would ensure agreement with international law . Third , it is essential to develop specific regulation that addresses emerging technologies on laws including the programming and the use of artificial intelligence . Fourth , the work of the group must consider the creation of effective verification and compliance mechanisms to guarantee the compliance with the rules established in the new instrument by facilitating effective and transparent implementation at the national and international level . And fifth , to conclude , international cooperation and exchange of know - how and best practices among the high contracting parties are essential in the development and the implementation of any new instrument . This collaborative approach must promote mutual understanding and an ability to address the challenges raised by laws . Hence it is essential that any regulatory instrument excludes the possibility for states to raise obstacles to international cooperation for the peaceful use of artificial intelligence technologies . Additionally and lastly , my Delegation would like to draw attention to the presentation on the organization of the work of the GGE on laws carried out by a significant number of Delegations including our own and which was included in the document presented by the Chair , 2024CRP1 . Mr. President , we would like to reiterate our commitment to actively participate in the implementation of the group's mandate in order to garner a consensus that would reflect our shared concerns and that would promote a safe and ethical future in the use of emerging technologies in the realm of laws . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
UNITED KINGDOM,15:16:23,2024-03-04,0:02:46,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . At the outset , let me congratulate you on assuming the position as Chair of this group and please be assured that the UK will support your efforts in a constructive and proactive manner . This is the first GGE meeting under our new mandate . The UK welcomes this new mandate as it provides the group with the clear opportunity to make meaningful progress with a view to delivering the results that the international community is expecting of this group . It sets us a definite goal to achieve and allows us good time in which to do so . It behooves this group to take that opportunity . Mr. Chair , this group has built a large body of work to support progress . We have a significant number of proposals to build from and a clear idea of the positions across them . The areas where we can solidify consensus and the areas of divergence . Nevertheless , they contain much detail that demonstrates that the areas of convergence vastly outweigh the areas of divergence . It is those elements that we should focus on to achieve a positive outcome . Areas of commonality are the application of IHL to all weapons , the centrality of human involvement and the importance of legal reviews . Areas of divergence include the need for a legally binding instrument and the manner of human involvement where differences still exist over terminology as well as the requirement for realtime supervision . The UK notes that despite divergence on the nature of the instrument that best services the call in our mandate , we can make significant and necessary progress through the exposition and articulation of the rules and practical considerations of use which apply to autonomous weapon systems . In that vein , the UK has cosponsored a proposal with our colleagues from the USA , Canada , Japan , Australia , Poland and the Republic of Korea which sets out a series of regulatory measures on the basis of international humanitarian law . It advocates a series of draft articles which would constitute an impactful measure by setting forth common international understandings of prohibitions and other regulatory regulations for the effective implementation of IHL principles and requirements in relation to laws . Mr. Chair , the UK Delegation looks forward to a fruitful meeting that makes good progress . Therefore , we commend you , Mr. Chair , for the guiding questions that you posed to us . I would encourage the conversation to be framed around textual prompts on screen which would better elicit meaningful engagement that will enable articulation of the various points of view . I thank you . Thank you for your intervention .",Western European and other States,Yes
TÜRKİYE,15:19:21,2024-03-04,0:02:59,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . We congratulate you for assuming this crucial role . As others also underline , CCW is the right forum to address emerging technologies on laws . We should refrain from stigmatizing technologies associated with laws in a way that could hamper civilian R&D and use of these technologies for civilian purposes . Also , we should bear in mind that AI decision support systems could enhance decision making in conflicts for humans by minimizing risks for civilians . In the absence of an agreed definition , developing a legally binding instrument would not serve our intended purpose here . We welcome the new mandate of GGE laws as a positive development for future . Having said that , the nature of a possible instrument to be developed in the GGE should not be prejudged . Based on 11 guiding principles adopted in 2019 , we should follow a step - by - step approach . We should prioritize developing a code of conduct or CBM mechanism to create a conducive environment to move forward . Mr. Chair , the international humanitarian law also applies to laws as is the case for all weapons . Development , production and use of laws that do not make a distinction by their nature are already prohibited by the 1949 Geneva Convention . Systems that perform in all steps of the targeting cycle outside of any form of human control or supervision are not technically feasible , militarily desirable or legally permissible in terms of IHL . The question of who must be held responsible , the programmer , producer or the commander for unintended damage caused by laws should also be regulated by national laws in light of international law . Given that wrongful acts are states' responsibilities under international law , unlawful use of technologies in laws is also the state's responsibility . A political guideline that will encourage state parties to make voluntary information exchanges and share best practices as a CBM on implementing existing applicable international law in the context of emerging technologies on laws would be helpful in applying international law . It would be useful to establish standards for responsible behavior and implement measures to increase transparency and communication as well as reduce risks of unintentional conflict and escalation . Mr. Chair , Turkey participates actively in trustworthy and responsible AI initiatives at the international level . We are a member of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence . We joined the Re-AIM call to action and the Bletchley Declaration . We are also among the 51 countries that endorsed the Political Declaration on Irresponsible Military Use of AI and Autonomy which provides an excellent basis for states to come together and positively commit to a range of tangible measures to mitigate risks in this critical area . I would like to conclude by assuring you of my country's readiness to engage constructively in our upcoming deliberations . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
PAKISTAN,15:22:35,2024-03-04,0:02:01,"I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Pakistan . Thank you , Mr. Chairperson . We have been deliberating upon various facets of lethal autonomous weapon system for over ten years . In the past decades our understanding of technical , legal , humanitarian , ethical and security dimensions of these weapon systems has increased resulting in varying degrees of convergence , for instance , in the shape of guiding principles adopted in 2019 and the overwhelming support for the two - tier approach . However , our discussions have yet to yield a set of agreed rules and legal norms while the development of laws on the grounds continue apace . We believe that our efforts in the CCW should continue with an aim to develop international rules through a new protocol . Such a protocol would need to clearly spell out prohibitions and regulations governing autonomous weapons systems to ensure compliance with the IHL and consistency with the objectives and purpose of the CCW . In this context we would like to draw your attention to proposals submitted by Pakistan last year in March in the CCW on an international legal instrument on laws . Mr. Chairperson , our new mandate when compared with previous year is more outcome driven and result oriented . It is therefore essential that our work in the GGE reflects this progression . Our success in the GGE will also help demonstrate the efficacy and relevance of the CCW as the venue for this topic . The task before us is profound responsibility and an urgent necessity . The decision we make or fail to make will shape the legacy we leave for generations to come . Let us proceed with the weight of this responsibility and resolve to act swiftly . We trust that all Delegations will do their part in enabling the GGE to develop a meaningful normative framework that responds to all challenges and concerns associated with laws . Thank you .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
AUSTRIA,15:24:48,2024-03-04,0:03:02,"Thank you . Mr. Chair , at the outset , let me congratulate you for taking up this mandate and the important work you have already undertaken . You can count on our full cooperation and support . The work of the CCW on autonomous weapons systems has started ten years ago with the first informal meeting in 2014 . Since then the world has not stood still . Technological progress in the field of AI has been breathtaking and the methods of warfare have changed considerably . Many of us had hoped to make use of one of the rare opportunities in history to regulate the weapon systems before it appears . We have almost failed to achieve this goal . These weapon systems do already exist or in other cases require only a small step to be used in an autonomous mode . In the face of such developments it is getting increasingly harder to set the fundamental ground rules that we urgently require . Mr. Chair , we have gathered under a new mandate for the TGE on laws . It allows us to discuss concrete elements for a future instrument . But aside from a few built in impediments , it has one considerable flaw . The new mandate does not take into account the urgency under which we operate . We cannot afford three years of talking . Delegations should commit to achieve results as soon as possible . To allow this mandate to be successful we need the good faith of all Delegations . The working papers circulated so far and other indications show that there is a lot of constructive engagement and willingness . We need to work on specific text and concrete concepts , many of which have been already part of our previous work . Austria will also introduce a working paper in this regard very soon . Austria supports the so - called two - tier approach that consists of prohibitions and regulations and in which meaningful control , meaningful human control is the key concept . But in this context we have to underline that the regulations part is equally important as the prohibitions and both require hard law . We also need to recall the importance of ethical considerations . They remain crucial in all questions related to the use of force against human through artificial intelligence . Furthermore , human rights law is of obvious relevance to the issue of autonomy and weapon systems and the various expected usages in different scenarios . Mr. Chair , the CCW is a framework that is designed to be expanded and enhanced by new legal protocols in phase of new technological or methodological developments in warfare . No one can doubt that this is currently the case . This task is to be fulfilled through legally binding prohibitions and regulations and this is what we need to focus on . Finally , let me also refer to Resolution 78/241 on lethal autonomous weapon systems adopted by the General Assembly on 22 nd December , 2023 . We are convinced that the report by the Secretary General mandated by this resolution will enrich and further our work by providing a more comprehensive perspective . We also want to invite Delegations to attend the Vienna Conference on Humanity at the Crossroads taking place in Vienna from 29th to 30th April , 2024 . A dedicated briefing on Wednesday during lunchtime will provide detailed information on that event . I thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
ITALY,15:28:08,2024-03-04,0:03:19,"I would like to give the floor to my Italian colleague . Thank you , Chair . At the outset , let me express my appreciation for the preparatory work you have conducted that allows us today to start this debate in a concrete manner on one of the most topical and sensitive issues in disarmament . You can count on our Delegations' full support to achieve meaningful results . Let me also thank the Chair of the previous Chair of the GGE , Ambassador D' Amico , for having steered this group through such complex issues leading us to a point from which it will be easier for us to move forward towards a satisfactory consensual outcome . Chair , technology is advancing much faster than multilateral negotiations . As G7 Presidency , Italy has set as one of its priorities the issue of emerging disruptive technologies . As the definition implies , these technologies pose multifaceted threats that demand attention and careful consideration . This is why it is extremely urgent to keep pace with these technological advances by developing the right normative framework , one that is broad enough to also cover developments in these technologies that at this moment we can only partially foresee . We have been debating the issue of laws for seven years now and we can confidently state that the issue is much clearer now as are the risks . We have also seen areas of convergence progressively expand as was clear during the previous mandate of this GGE and in the report adopted in May 2023 . For instance , thanks also to the very precious contributions from organizations such as the ICRC and civil society . It seems to us that there is a growing understanding on the two - tier approach based on the prohibition of those systems that cannot comply with IHL and regulate those with autonomous features . Italy has always been committed to making concrete progress on these issues . We have co-signed a working paper for consideration of this group together with five other countries providing concrete elements for a future instrument . This is indeed the goal that we have set ourselves . An instrument within the CCW that reaffirms the applicability of IHL builds on the work conducted so far including the 2019 / 11 guiding principles , characterizes and defines the systems , prohibits some of them and regulates others , foresees mitigation measures and technical safeguards and creates mechanisms for consultation and cooperation . Our goal now should be to work as concretely as possible on those elements with a view to agreeing on them by the end of 2025 . I thank you , Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
BULGARIA,15:31:38,2024-03-04,0:02:52,"Thank you , Mr. Chairman . At the outset allow me to congratulate you on the assumption of the chairmanship of the GG on laws and to express our high appreciation of your dedicated leadership . Be assured of Bulgaria's full support for your and your team efforts . Mr. Chairman , our Delegation deeply values your proactive and dynamic approach towards preparing and organizing this session of the GGE as the expectation of our common work and the sense of urgency are growing higher . We take note of the fact established by the mandate that the group should submit a report to the 7th review conference in 2026 . Yet as already mentioned by several Delegates the group does not begin its work from scratch . We profit from several years of fruitful and concentrated deliberations , previously adopted GG reports and dozens of working papers . Therefore , also having in mind the emerging urgency , our Delegation believes that the group should undertake every endeavor to streamline its work and preferably to fulfill its mandate ahead of the set time frame of three years . We support your call to the group to focus on the mandate and to start working on a concrete language and on identifying and formulating elements of an instrument . As the necessity of having structured deliberations exists we find the guiding questions circulated to be definitely beneficial . Here we would like to express our gratitude to the high contracting parties and the groups of states who have submitted answers to the guiding questions and to the ISU for complying the replies . We are still in the process of examining the submissions as well as Brazil's working paper and we will be anticipating constructive deliberations throughout the week . Mr. Chairman , Bulgaria joined Denmark , France , Germany , Italy , Luxembourg and Norway in submitting a working paper centered around the two - tier approach as it establishes a solid structure within the GG on cross-regional level which directs the groups , the group in a favorable and universally functional way . The convergence on the two - tier approach based on prohibitions and regulations could be considered as one of the achievements of the work of the group . We believe that the two - tier approach with its inclusivity and ability to combine numerous viewpoints could serve as a legitimate and conducive framework for the implementation of the current mandate of the GG . Thank you , Mr. Chairman .",Eastern European States,Yes
CHINA,15:35:10,2024-03-04,0:03:15,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . I congratulate you on your assumption as the Chair of the GGE on laws . Laws is a topic at the forefront of the global AI governance . In October 2023 , China proposed the global AI governance initiative which stresses that the development of the AI must respect applicable international law . All countries , especially the major powers when researching , developing and applying the AI technology in the military field must adopt a prudent and responsible attitude and make sure that AI is always under human control . Laws is the product of technological development and new revolution of military affairs . In addition to humanitarian concerns , all parties should also focus on the prevention of new arms race , strike balance among humanitarian concerns , military necessities and the impact on strategic balance and stability and oppose using laws as a tool to wage wars and seek hegemony . Mr. Chair , I would like to take this opportunity to brief China's position on several issues to be discussed in this session . First of all , China always advocates that all parties should reach a common understanding on the characterization and definitions of laws and on this basis negotiate and conclude a legally binding instrument . In absence of a clear characterization and definitions , we may exercise a tiered management on the laws as per their technical characteristics and relevant risks . China has proposed the five technical characteristics of unacceptable laws and is ready to engage in further discussions . Secondly , China is of the view that as a means and method of combat , laws must respect the Geneva Convention and its additional protocols as well as other basic principles and provisions of the IHL . Yet it is shown in the previous discussions that great uncertainty remains as to whether the current IHL is adequate to respond to the challenges . Relevant issues remain to be further studied . Thirdly , currently most countries , including China , have established strict review and assessment mechanisms for novel weapons and have adopted necessary risk mitigation measures and confidence building measures . Yet these measures are generally nonbinding in nature and can hardly address the concerns on laws in the fundamental way . China supports the discussion for protocol similar to the protocol on blinding laser weapons in order to ban the use of fully autonomous weapons . Given that CCW involves the major military countries , its contracting parties have conducted in depth discussions on laws . CCW is the most appropriate venue to address the laws issues . China will continue to constructively participate in relevant processes , work hard with all sides and in line with the mandate seek new progress in the work of GGE . The full text of this statement will be submitted to the Secretariat . Thank you , Mr. Chair .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
ALGERIA,15:38:35,2024-03-04,0:03:13,"Thank you very much , President . At the outset , I would like to express to you on behalf of the Delegation of Algeria our warm congratulations on your nomination to guide the work of the group of governmental experts on laws . I rest assured of the full support of my Delegation to your presidency in order to ensure that we can move forward with a view of achieving the progress that we all wish to achieve on the questions of SALA on holistic and inclusive approach in the spirit of continuity . Algeria has always been in the same position on our work in questions of laws based on the CCW , this key legal framework that expands the provisions of IHL while recognizes the peaceful possibility for peaceful use of such technologies for peaceful purposes . My Delegation does hope that before the end of its mandate , the GG on laws will be able to come up with specific regulations and recommendations on laws . The contributions presented by some Delegations confirm that the work on substance conducted by the GGE in the 2023 report can represent a foundation that will help us come up with specific recommendations on questions of laws . The launching of negotiations on this subject is a critical need reflecting the convergence of views as we continue to our discussions on outstanding issues . The need to ensure complementarity between the elements of different approaches related to binding and nonbinding measures that can be implemented has to be stressed , taking into account that the CCW on the basis of Article 8 has established the format and statute of new rules as a result of negotiations of a new instrument following the five other protocols . We believe that the guidelines that state that international law applies to laws has to be made more specific to the clarification of different questions and development of new rules that will fill the legal gap that exists and that should be the work of this GGE . A legally binding instrument seems to be the only way that will help us determine the obligations within the same and transposable framework that then can be reflected in national legislation so that countries implement these obligations the same way . The GGE on laws should take into account the orientations that are contained in the agenda for peace of the Secretary General and the ambitious objectives that have been put into place by the summit of the future to provide practical and specific answers to specific challenges in the area of laws and artificial intelligence . Thank you .",African States,Yes
MEXICO,15:42:04,2024-03-04,0:03:26,"I would like to give the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Mexico . Thank you , President . I would like to congratulate you on your assumption to preside over the work of this group and you can count on the support of Mexico and cooperation of Mexico . Mr. President , the current world has seen exponential development of new technologies among them artificial intelligence , robotics that has a significant impact as we have seen in armed conflicts . Now we have to regulate autonomy and we still have even though the time has passed to impose initial regulations we still have time in order to avoid serious impact on international peace and security . In this respect we appreciate and support the appeal of the joint appeal of the Secretary General and the President of the ICRC to adopt legally binding instrument reflecting the demands of civil society , academics and industry . We believe their participation in our work is crucial . Laws present serious ethical and social consideration that very often are not discussed in our work . Nevertheless , such considerations have to be crucial as we continue our in depth work on this issues and this is why we support what was said by Pakistan earlier today under agenda item 4 from the point of view of security . Laws present risks of asymmetric wars and they reduce the threshold of the use of force and escalation of conflicts . Ethical considerations are crucial in our work . And we must ensure that decisions on life and death are taken by humans and not by machines , especially machines that use sensors . Only humans can evaluate the situation correctly . Also the ethical perspective has another dimension that is recognized by IHL when it established that methods and means of war are not limited and the use of force should be guided by principles of humanities and dictates of public conscience that by definition can only be accomplished by human beings . From a legal point of view , my country believes that the due application of the fundamental principles of IHL requires meaningful human control . Nevertheless , ten years of discussions had made it possible to see different approaches to this issue and the need to be more specific on the contents . And this means that this group should develop specific regulations that will make it possible to have common understanding related to obligations and to overcome different interpretations by states of existing IHL and also recognize that this issue has appeared and is also very important from a human rights point of view . My Delegation believes that even though we wish to achieve a legally binding instrument as most Delegations , most countries that are in favor of this , including the NAM and Mr. President , you can count on the constructive participation of my Delegation during this meeting .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
REPUBLIC OF KOREA,15:45:40,2024-03-04,0:02:23,"Thank you , Chair . Good afternoon , colleagues . Like others , my Delegation wishes to congratulate you , Ambassador Indemosh , for assuming the Chairpersonship of this group . The ROK places its full confidence in and support for the able leadership of the Chair as you carry out your noble endeavors at this critical juncture . My Delegation very much looks forward to continuing our constructive deliberations to reap early harvests through focusing on concrete , detailed and readily implementable measures that will form an integral part of a set of elements of an instrument and other possible measures we are mandated to consider and formulate . To this end , and for this particular subject matter , we place substance over form or as the Chair put it , form follows functions and believe that what is important here is to actually progress . As such , it would be effective to begin our new cycle of work by diving straight into specifying concepts and terminologies that will embody in writing the widely accepted two - tiered approach centering on IHL compliance into actual practice . My Delegation , therefore , deems the focused approach outlined in the Chair's letter of February 16 as well as the indicative timetable and the compilation of submissions as an effective basis of our work . We look forward to a results - oriented exchange during relevant discussions on selected topics with a view to further bridging differences and building consensus on converging and practical elements . In addition to its contributions within this unique forum to address the issue of laws , my Delegation is committed to fostering global discussion on AI governance in the military domain . To descend , the Republic of Korea will organize the second RIM Summit together with the Netherlands on September 9 and 10 this year in Seoul . Further details will be shared in due course . With these remarks , Chair , my Delegation reiterates its readiness to continue its constructive participation and in doing so , my Delegation will undertake every effort to embrace a spirit of genuine cooperation as we work towards a consensual outcome . Thank you .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
SINGAPORE,15:48:22,2024-03-04,0:02:32,"Thank you , Distinguished Chair . At the outset , we wish to extend our appreciation to you and express our full support for your efforts to steward the important work of this group . Singapore is pleased to share that we deposited our instrument of accession to the CCW in September last year . Singapore will become a high contracting party in the coming weeks and we look forward to participating in that capacity in future meetings . Singapore's accession to the CCW underscores our commitment to international humanitarian law . The CCW as a framework convention has yielded important protocols that have further enhanced international law . Singapore is committed to the continued codification and progressive developments of the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict . Under the ambit of the CCW , discussions on laws began formally seven years ago . In 2023 , the group agreed on the two - tier approach constituting the prohibition of laws that cannot be used in compliance with IHL and the regulation of other types of laws through limits on types of targets , duration , geographical scope and scale of operations . We hope for further progress in the further meetings of the group under the current mandate going beyond the consensus achieved in 2023 . Singapore values that the current mandate of the group focuses on elements of an instrument without prejudging its nature . This enables us to focus on substantive questions , recognizing that norms and legally binding instruments are complementary and not mutually exclusive . We hope progress can be made in defining pathways to preserve the human element in the use of force as well as risk mitigation measures . Singapore believes that the CCW is the appropriate forum for the discussion of laws . In addition , Singapore supported UN General Assembly Resolution 78/241 on laws . As many UN Member States are not yet high contracting parties to the CCW , the Secretary - General's call for Member States to submit views on laws facilitates participation from a wider range of states . Singapore also values regional initiatives on this topic and related issues . Let me speak of two recent events in Southeast Asia . In December , the Philippines hosted the Manila meeting on Indo - Pacific perspectives on autonomous weapon systems and just last week Singapore co-hosted the regional consultations for Asia on responsible AI in the military domain together with the Netherlands and the Republic of Korea . Singapore looks forward to a fruitful GGE session in the week ahead and to engaging widely with participating states as well as other stakeholders . I thank you , Chair .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
IRAN (ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF),15:51:13,2024-03-04,0:03:11,"Thank you , Chairman . At the outset , I express my appreciation for the opportunity to engage in discussions on the autonomous weapon system . From the beginning and in recent years , we have closely followed the development and discussion regarding laws diligently seeking to understand its various phases and implications . In this way , I would like to express the preliminary comments of my Delegation . Today , we bring forth our perspective cultivated through observation and analysis to continue constructively to ongoing dialogue with a focus on critical examination . We offer insight aimed at fostering common outcome of laws and advancing effective regulation within the national community without prejudging its nature . Mr. Chairman , due to the potential challenges posed by divorce perspective and methodologies , we advocate for an inclusive , transparent and balanced approach in our deliberation on the laws . By allowing methodologies and consolidating efforts , we can enhance coherence and synergy in our analysis ultimately fostering a unified framework for addressing the complexity of laws . According to our view , two significant issues have emerged . Firstly , the production of divorce literature across multiple firms and initiatives . Secondly , the broad agenda under framework of GG on laws and its required discussions . Such questions have led to fragmentation and confusion within the discourse surrounding laws . The ambiguities in agenda appear to be the reason for the proliferation of discussion across different firms . Taking into account the negotiations that accumulate in the formulation of GG agenda , we encounter some ambiguities . Despite the opposition of some states , an extensive agenda was set for GG by insisting on the inclusion of emerging technologies . In this regard , the review of the consultation of 2013 and 2014 consultation are not worthy . In addressing this complex issue , it is crucial to adopt a methodological approach ensuring clarity , coherence , effectiveness in our deliberation . Our perspective aligns with the pragmatic approach to regulating different category of laws , focusing on laws as the final product and subject of regulation rather than attempting to address each and every emerging technologies contributing to their development could expedite the regulatory process and facilitate more effective decision making . We do believe that the following proposal could contribute to GG's success . One , emphasize on single approach . Two , common understanding should be achieved . Three , humanitarian angle and focus on concept of lethality including offensive weapon system as a priority , human factor roles as a nodal point of IHL and ethical imperative and human dignity . I thank you , Mr. Chair .",Asia-Pacific States,No
INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR ROBOT ARMS CONTROL,15:54:47,2024-03-04,0:03:28,"Thank you , Chair . The International Committee for Robot Arms Control , ICRC , joins fellow Delegations in extending congratulations to you for assuming leadership for this meeting . Chair , it has been over a decade since the issue of lethal autonomous weapon systems laws was brought to the attention of states within the United Nations . Throughout these years , stakeholders have highlighted the legal , ethical and security concerns that are raised by laws and the urgent need for a legally binding instrument . ICRC calls on states to urgently move towards negotiations of a legally binding instrument that contains both prohibitions and positive obligations . Chair , during this week's discussions , ICRC calls on states to remember that civilian protection lies at the center of the CCW framework . Indeed , the CCW preamble recalls the general principle of the protection of the civilian population against the effects of hostilities . It is critical to note that the general principle on the protection of civilians is found in various branches of international law , including international human rights law , the UN law against use of force that is used at Bellum , international criminal law , international environmental law , et cetera . Thus , whilst the UN GGE on laws has for the past decade more fully focused on international humanitarian law , that is IHL , implications of laws , it is critical for the sake of comprehensiveness and civilian protection to also discuss implications of laws to other legal regimes such as use at Bellum , the UN law against use of force . Indeed , the preamble refers to use at Bellum where it notes that every state is the duty in conformity with the charter of the United Nations to refrain in its international relations from the threat of use of force against the sovereignty to the integrity or political independence of any state . Further , the CCW notes that in creating this convention , one of the most important nation's desires was ending of the arms race and moving towards the realization of aspirations of all people to live in peace . Laws have implications on many people's right to live in peace and it is not at all to move towards ending of arms race . I encourage stakeholders to engage in further discussions regarding implications of laws on use at Bellum at the upcoming intergovernmental conference on peace and security aspect of autonomous open systems in Freetown , Sierra Leone , that was mentioned earlier by the Delegation from Sierra Leone . Indeed , peace is a human right . As a unique regional human rights instrument adopted after several years of violence perpetrated on the bodies of African peoples through slavery , colonialism , neocolonialism , et cetera , the African charter on human peoples' rights uniquely provides for a stand - alone right to national and international peace in Article 23 . When discussing laws , prioritizing the preservation of the right to peace is critical , particularly for those who more than often are disproportionately affected by violence . Chair , during this week , I crack eagerly anticipates contributing on agenda item 5 concerning the application of the human rights . I ask you to round up , please , your intervention , please . I thank you for your intervention .",Non-applicable,No
GCSP,15:58:30,2024-03-04,0:03:06,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . All of us at GCSP are pleased to see you chairing the GG and we wish you and your team all the very best with your important work . Mr. Chair , the GCSP welcomes the group's new mandate seeing it as a concrete step which moves the discussion forward . We firmly believe that the work of the group should remain grounded in a realistic assessment of technological realities linked to lethal autonomous weapon systems as well as the ways in which these technologies are used at present . We would therefore like to remind the group that a sober assessment of the state of autonomous weapon systems is needed . In 2024 , it is high time the group began appreciating the fact that we are already today dangerously close to the full realization of laws . A recent Russian study found that the software , hardware and expertise necessary to develop a minimally functioning laws are widely available . Evidence from the battlefields of Ukraine and Gaza further shows us the reality of an already highly autonomous battlefield where decision making , targeting decisions and even target engagement are already highly algorithmically assisted with varying levels of actual human oversight and involvement . These active war zones are acting as a catalyst for the development and deployment of these weapons . The GCSP urges the group to more directly use evidence from the real world use of these autonomous capabilities in its work . In light of the group's convergence towards the need for some level of control in the use of autonomous weapons to guarantee their compliance with IHL and in view of discussing elements of an instrument , the GCSP encourages states to use the 2024 GGE to further clarify human control requirements for the appropriate use of autonomous weapon systems and consider making these clarifications part of any instrument resulting from the group's work . Specifications are direly needed , less states resort to so - called instances of nominal human control . Mr. Chair , research into automation bias clearly shows that humans have a tendency to increasingly defer to machine suggestions the more autonomous a system is . Increasing autonomous weapon systems might therefore result in increasingly performative or nominal human control measures . Failure to clarify what amounts to meaningful human control which actually ensures potential compliance with IHL will result in a situation where weapon systems are developed with various kinds of human oversight mechanisms , meaningful , effective or appropriate only in name . This would not be a satisfactory level of human involvement . Here human oversight would legitimize these weapon systems in the eyes of IHL without acting as an actual effective fail safe . Regardless of the qualifier it should refer to control in which a human has the necessary contextual understanding and cognitive and physical capacity to critically engage with any systems , suggestions or actions .

ICRC,16:01:44,2024-03-04,0:02:36,"Thank you , Chair . The ICRC welcomes resumption of this group's work and we congratulate you Ambassador Indenbosch on your appointment as Chair . A new year often brings renewed optimism and reflecting back on 2023 and looking ahead we are optimistic about momentum towards effective rules on autonomous weapon systems . We saw this momentum notably in October with the UN General Assembly Resolution when the overwhelming majority of states stressed the urgent need for action to address the challenges raised by autonomous weapons . This mirrored the joint call by ICRC's President and the UN Secretary General for political leaders to negotiate by 2026 a new legally binding instrument on autonomous weapons with clear prohibitions and restrictions . Then in December the Manila Conference provided a valuable space to hear diverse Indo - Pacific perspectives and we are looking forward to continued engagement in Vienna and in Freetown . This group's discussions have progressed significantly over the last decade but so has the development of autonomous weapon technologies . Several companies claim that their armed drones can strike autonomously and in some cases that they already have in current armed conflicts . It is difficult to verify these claims of use but our assessment is that the infrastructure does exist . The timeline of this group's mandate is long but this cannot foster complacency . Rather it must be taken as an opportunity to make genuine substantive progress to build on last year's conclusions and to articulate the kinds of autonomous weapons that could not be used in compliance with international law along with others that must be prohibited and to elaborate the specifics of the restrictions needed for all others . Some of this detail can definitely be drawn from the concrete language already submitted by states and we encourage high contracting parties to engage constructively across proposals and across groupings . States must act now to prohibit unpredictable and antipersonnel autonomous weapons and to impose clear restrictions on all others . Future generations must be able to look back at this group and see that it responded effectively and in time to protect them from the serious risks posed by these technologies . The ICRC stands ready to support all states in this important work this week and in the year ahead . I thank you , Chair .",Non-applicable,No
PAX,16:04:29,2024-03-04,0:03:30,"Congratulations on your appointment in this role . We look forward to working with you this year . Increasingly we are seeing weapon systems with autonomous functions being developed and used in ongoing conflicts . These conflicts are being used as test beds for technologies with increasing levels of autonomy . This is extremely concerning in the absence of clear rules and limits that specifically apply to these weapons . Especially as developers and users are pushing the limits of what is acceptable and the legal and ethical norms . This demonstrates the urgent need to develop a legal instrument related to autonomous weapons . In the recent years we have seen positive developments including the call of the UN Secretary General and the ICRC to develop a legal instrument by 2026 . Also , there are now over 100 states calling for a legally binding instrument . We have seen Latin American and the CARICOM declarations both calling for a legal instrument as well as the meetings in Luxembourg , the Netherlands and the Philippines . Looking ahead , there will be an ECOWAS conference in Sierra Leone as well as a meeting of states in Austria . These meetings are extremely important to demonstrate states' desire to develop a new norm and moving forward on the issue . Over the last two years we have seen increasing convergence of views on possible elements of a normative framework . The majority of states agree that rules and limits are needed . These states see a combination of prohibitions and regulations as necessary and that human control and judgment should be central in a regulatory framework . An increasing number of states also see the need to set limits in geographical area and duration of use . Based on these commonalities , we believe we can further develop possible elements of a normative framework . The majority of states , if not all , agree that the human user must be able to make a legal and moral judgment regarding the effects of an attack as well as being accountable for any violations of legal and ethical norms . Based on this , we can develop three possible principles , namely , the user should have a functional understanding of how the weapon system works , specifically what will trigger an application of force . Secondly , the user should have sufficient understanding of the context where the weapon system will be deployed . For example , being aware of the presence of civilian and civilian infrastructure . The human user must be able to limit the functioning of the weapon system . Logically , following from this , autonomous weapons that cannot be used in line with these obligations should be prohibited . Concluding , over the last few years , the discussions at the GGE have been useful regarding policy development . At the same time , we have all seen the difficulty of coming to concrete normative outcome . We do believe that the GGE continues to be a useful forum . But we should not limit ourselves to only one forum , but should be able to work in all four . Based on the increasing convergences on policy , as well as the growing support for legal instrument , we believe this is not only possible , but inevitable . Thank you , Chair . Thank you for your intervention .",Non-applicable,No
INTERAGENCY INSTITUTE,16:08:08,2024-03-04,0:02:13,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . Our full statement will be available online . The interagency institute wishes this presidency to be fruitful and looks forward to working with you . First , we will discuss risk mitigation . Then we will talk about the importance of meaningful human control . Finally , we will end with a call for action . Mr. Chair , the interagency institute highlights the expansion of AI programs in countries of the west , global north , has happened in parallel with the political tensions and political distances between the global south and the global north . Such a trend may accelerate differences , reducing the capacity to diffuse crises and disputes of interests . Amara's law says we overestimate the short - term impact of a technology but underestimate its long - term effect . We urge careful consideration . Supporting the creation of these technologies today might lead to their use in ways that could affect your own communities adversely in the future . Mr. Chair , for meaningful human control to be established and IAGL respected , we must reject technology agnostically approaches . We agree with the working paper submitted by the Brazilian Delegation on the necessity of establishing limits on targets , duration , geographical scope and scale of operations , adding the necessity to prohibit autonomous engagement . Mr. Chair , as a team composed mostly of native Portuguese speakers , the interagency institute calls on the Portuguese speaking countries to take leadership on this topic . We thank Brazilian Ambassador for chairing this conference during the last years and acknowledges that the challenges this forum faced happened despite his great diplomatic abilities and skillful mediation of negotiations . We celebrate the efforts made by Cabo Verde through sponsoring the draft resolution on laws that led to the General Assembly Resolution 78/241 . It was a step towards a legally binding instrument . I thank you .",Non-applicable,No
CAMPAIGN TO STOP KILLER ROBOTS,16:10:35,2024-03-04,0:03:29,"I am speaking on behalf of stop killer robots , a global coalition of over 250 civil society organizations across 70 countries with the shared commitment to achieving international law prohibiting and regulating autonomous weapons systems . At this meeting taking place we implore states to remember that the CCW is not taking place in a vacuum . The protection of civilians , the reinforcement of multilateralism and international humanitarian law are needed now more than ever . In an increasingly fractured world states have an opportunity to play a positive role by taking tangible steps towards the creation of essential safeguards on autonomous weapons . These steps must be taken urgently and decisively . The lack of clarity around the capabilities of weapons systems and their autonomous functions and the trend towards increasing autonomy in warfare including in current conflicts highlight why new international law on autonomy in weapons system is desperately needed . States must act to ensure meaningful human control over the use of force to reject digital dehumanization and prevent the automation of killing . This is the first meeting of the CCW since the pivotal vote of the UN General Assembly last year where resounding support for the first resolution on autonomous weapons demonstrated widespread desire from states to make progress towards new international law . States must embrace all inclusive processes to foster multilateralism and to promote engagement among states and other stakeholders and we strongly encourage all states to submit their views to be included in the report of the UN Secretary General later this year . Here at the GGE substantive decisions over the last decade have contributed to shared policy understandings in particular on the need for both prohibitions and regulations and the key elements required for maintaining meaningful human control . Chair , we see increasing agreement on the characterization of autonomous weapons systems as those that select and apply force to targets without human intervention . The primary concern is the autonomous identification and application of force to a target without human control and judgment over the effects of an attack such that a human operator does not determine specifically where , when or against what force is applied . Target selection and engagement are critical functions which should remain within meaningful human control . Meaningful human control is necessary to ensure that states meet existing legal and moral obligations and to ensure that accountability and responsibility in the use of force is maintained . The path ahead is clear to prevent digital dehumanization and the reckless slide towards the automation of killing . The international community must come together to strengthen international law and achieve a legally binding instrument on autonomous weapons systems to ensure a meaningful human control in the use of force . Stop killer robots stands ready and willing to support all states in this effort . Our coalition is united and unwavering in this goal and we will not cease pushing for this outcome using all forums that are available to make real progress on this issue .

REPUBLIC OF KOREA,16:29:29,2024-03-04,0:02:31,"Thank you . I still do not know how to use a microphone . This is just to break the ice . I wanted to express my Delegation's appreciation to the Chair's work . This is precisely what we had intended to request the Chair to do , to break down the discussions into bits that we can discuss . So this overall approach is what we actually support and I am not sure how deep we are going into the discussions , but since I have the floor , I will go ahead and make , I guess , initial or preliminary remarks on what is presented on the screen . Go right to the third bullet . So my Delegation proposed the first , I guess , to identify , select and engage . My Delegation is of the view that the word "" track "" would not be necessary when we try to put this down in writing because , for instance , I will give you a specific example . For those autonomous systems such as the sentry gun , we will have a very static position . It will not be moving mobile and tracking the targets , but the word "" engage "" will be , I think , sufficient to cover the aspect that these weapon systems will be used . So by putting down the word "" track , "" it will actually narrow down the scope of what we are trying to discuss or regulate . And we would like to see the word somewhere "" lethal force "" or "" applied force with lethal consequences "" because the item laws is about lethal weapons . Again , for those systems , for instance , that use rubber bullets , it will not be considered lethal weapon systems . So those should be put away from our purview of discussion . So we would need to see some kind of wording that implies the lethal effects of these weapon systems . And finally , we also inserted the word "" intervention by an operator , "" human operator , because by definition , that would , I mean , relate to the subject , autonomous weapons . So it would not require any human involvement to have the effect of autonomous weapon systems . That is our view at this time . Thank you . Thank you very much for that and for this explanation of the proposals you earlier put on the table together with a number of other countries . Who else would like to ?",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,16:32:22,2024-03-04,0:07:00,"Thank you very much . Thank you very much , Distinguished President . At the outset , I would like to join my colleague from the Republic of Korea in expressing our gratitude for your attempt to prepare such a document , an attempt to consolidate the different views or opinions that were expressed by different Delegations during this work of the GGG that has been going on for quite some time , work related to definitions and characterizations of what we are discussing here . We would like to share with you our very preliminary considerations in connection with what we see on the screen because this is the first time we are looking at this document and it is the first time we are considering the proposals that are contained in the document . Of course , all of our discussions right now are really preliminary in their nature , very general , and we believe that the results of this discussion will require really serious further work back in capital by all Delegations . Now , our preliminary remarks on the bullet points that you are proposing , we fully realize that any attempt to bring different approaches together will in one way or another will lead us to a certain bias in favor of one concept , one notion or another one . Right now , as we see it , the notion of human control is taken as the main idea and , in fact , I would refer to meaningful human control and as well as also trying to come up with a definition through the critical functions of the system . Now , we do not fully share that approach . We believe that we should try to take a step - by - state approach as we try to agree on a definition of such systems . First , what we need to do is to define what types of weapon systems we are talking about . We discussed that for quite some time and our colleague from the Republic of Korea also referred to that fact when he tried to say that most likely we should be talking about lethal systems and we believe that we have to discuss this topic as well to discuss the topic of what type of weapon systems we are referring to . A second very important factor as we try to come up with such a definition relates to the objectives that these systems are pursuing and this refers first and foremost to the third and fourth bullet point . Here we see that there are certain objectives that are listed and we see that this is done in a very narrow manner , but in any case , we are ready to discuss these objectives that could be pursued by such systems that would fall under the definition of emerging technologies in the area of laws and third important point or factor and it relates to human control . We believe that we will be discussing the question of human control in a detailed fashion under the second agenda item that you have submitted to the GGE and in a very preliminary way we would like to say that we find that trying to identify the specific functions where human control will apply is something that is counterproductive and not really advisable because of the different views that Delegations have on that subject and also this relates to the factor of the responsibilities that states have in complying with their international obligations including in the area of IHL where there is a clear definition of the responsibility of states' parties for ensuring relevant human control related to the use of different weapons systems and this obviously refers to the entire life cycle of such weapons systems and that understanding if I am not mistaken is something that we agreed to on the basis of consensus as one of the guidelines and also as one of the conclusions that this GGE made in the past . Thank you .",Eastern European States,Yes
BELGIUM,16:40:06,2024-03-04,0:03:34,"Thank you , Mr. President . Well , Mr. President , given that this is the very first time that my Delegation has taken the floor , I would like to take this opportunity to commend you on taking on the Chairmanship of the GGE and you can rely on the full support of my Delegation . Mr. President , to address the substantive discussion as fast as possible , Belgium decided not to offer a statement during the general statements section and to make our comments of the specific agenda items at the different states . That said , I would like to reiterate our gratitude to you for the way in which we have led the debates which we hope will allow us to make headway in the discussions . On characterizations and definition , I would like to elaborate on our country's position on this point . When it comes to definition of autonomous weapon system , it has already taken up a significant amount of time in the debates and yet a definition has not yet reached a consensus . We could excessively define an autonomous weapon system but that for my Delegation would be attempting to tilted windmills . It is impossible . With modern systems , it is quite likely that such a definition would be obsolete or just on the verge of being obsolete as soon as it is adopted . According to my Delegation , we should rather focus on the common characteristics that autonomous weapon systems might have and on the effects that autonomy brings on . With that in mind , my Delegation would like to support the proposals that were on the screen which no longer are but I am sure they will come back up in just a moment or two . Additionally , Belgium chooses to not use the LOS acronym . Instead , we prefer autonomous weapons system . The notion of lethal is not defined international system . It is not relevant to decide whether or not a system is in keeping or countered to international material law and violates international material law . It can not take place without causing any deaths . And contrary to the point raised by the Republic of Korea or by the Russian Federation , my Delegation welcomes the absence of the notion of lethal in the points that are found currently on the screen . Also for operational reasons that were mentioned already in the previous GGE , my Delegation is more in favor of identify , select and engage than to the other alternatives found on the screen . These three concepts seem to reflect a continuum in hostility gamut . And bearing in mind the difficulty of defining an acceptable level of autonomy , Belgium rather is to consider the level of human control which would allow to adapt a human system to the respect of international humanitarian law . And in that regard , my Delegation has already spoken several times about the concept of meaningful human control which we support human intervention or intervention by an operator . Thank you . Thank you for your intervention and for highlighting also your national position .",Western European and other States,Yes
AUSTRIA,16:43:58,2024-03-04,0:03:40,"We would also like to share some of our observations on the characterization debate which are quite similar to the ones that we had already last year but I think it is still important to also share some general views on this topic but we will also share some views on the text on the screen . First , maybe I directly react to some of the observations from other Delegations that we heard . This , if you go into a text like this , we do not see the text on the screen directly related to human control as was indicated by the Russian Federation , especially if you go to the last part on the last bullet , this is more in our view a definition of autonomy . It is not yet a definition of human control or how this applies . This is something that we have to do at some other part which is probably way more important but I will come to that . On the question of lethality , we are of the same position as Belgium . This word is not very useful and not needed in our discussion . It rather creates confusion and we would happily drop the lethal even in the title of our Working Group . In general , we also think a precise definition is not needed for provision of certain types of autonomous weapon systems for us to continue our discussions . At the same time , it is , of course , useful and we see that there is a need from a number of Delegations for us to move forward . We would consider this then as a working definition and if we go into that direction , we find the definition by the ICRC as the most useful and sufficient one which describes autonomous weapon systems as weapons of select and apply force to targets without human intervention . Coming to the text here , we see some useful additions to that . I think technologies that enable is useful as it implies a technology neutral approach . This is also something we have advocated many times before . If we address function of autonomy and weapon systems , it is much more useful than talking about categories of weapons . Such an approach was already promoted in the past by states but also it can be found in several Chair's papers in summaries of previous years going back many years . It takes into account the fact that almost any weapon system can incorporate autonomous functions and systems are becoming more and more complex . We see an inherent risk that too much detailed deliberations might be overtaken by technological developments . That is why a technological neutral approach is so important and by inserting this little part here at the beginning proposed by three states , I think we are taking this into account . Once activated is probably also a useful addition in the rest as mentioned before , we prefer the well established and also age old formulations by the ICRC which is select and engage , apply force and the human intervention . Not sure if we need the different objectives at the beginning of the last bullet and I think these are the main points that we want to make . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
THE CIVILIAN AGENDA,16:48:07,2024-03-04,0:04:18,"Hello . There we go . Thank you , Chair . The civilian agenda is a newly formed civil society organization concerned with civilian protection in armed conflict . I have been privileged to participate in meetings of the GGE over several years and appreciate the substantial progress that has been made dealing with prohibitions and regulations and yet this question of characterization and definition has been one of the areas that we have struggled with . It is something that we have said that we would come back to towards the end and perhaps this is the right time to deal with that given that it has been 10 years of discussions . The words on the page that you have there , I would say very properly capture the wide range of states' views on this issue , but we must be careful not to do our work in a bubble . We are seeing already systems with very sophisticated forms of automation and military AI such as sentry turrets , loitering munitions , robotanks , smart shooters and military AI targeting systems , all of which we have struggled to identify as to whether or not they are an autonomous weapon system . That means that these systems are so far being developed and used and invested in outside any of the regulations and prohibitions that we may or may not agree to in the end . We must return to this issue and we must not do it in a bubble , but we must be careful that it is actually impacting the real world . There is one critical comment that I would like to make about the proposed text . I would say the beginning is excellent , the middle is excellent , but there is a point at the end that must be addressed . The line at the end which says without further human intervention has a significant potential to create a loophole , because what happens is you have a system that is activated and proceeds to select and engage a target and most of the systems that we see allow some form of human input after the system has been activated . That might be some keyboard button that is pressed or some form of input that may be far removed from where the actual force is being applied . So the human who is actually doing that input is dislocated , disconnected and disempowered from the actual use of force and these systems entail all the same risks that we have been speaking about in the GGE , risks around accountability , responsibility , whether or not there is adequate distinction between civilians and combatants and yet they are outside the scope of regulation because they have this meager nominal form of input that takes place after the activation and indeed we are seeing weapons manufacturers actually state our system has the minimum necessary level of human input to make it not an autonomous weapon system . So this is crucial because if we are to succeed in actually dealing with the types of systems that are of concern through the GGE we need to address that particular problem . So how do we do that ? I have had the opportunity to think about it quite a bit in the years that I have been participating in these meetings and in fact I would like to offer a proposal for thought . I would suggest that instead of the word human intervention we use the word human agency . That would mean that if a human is making a nominal human input we would be able to say they are not exercising agency and therefore it is still an autonomous weapon system . We need to problematize that specific point because if we leave that out we may end up having a framework that is totally useless frankly . So I propose that text for thought and I would like to invite participants here to a workshop being held here on Friday during the lunch break titled what are autonomous weapon systems ? A proposal for the GGE and it is 90 % the same as what you have there which is captured by states but we need to problematize this issue of intervention versus agency in the nominal human input otherwise we risk making a toothless framework . Thank you , Chair .",Non-applicable,No
BRAZIL,16:52:34,2024-03-04,0:02:56,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . I would like to also thank you and your team for the preparation of this interesting compilation of the ideas that we have discussed thus far . I think it shows that there is quite an impressive amount of convergence actually between the proposals that have been put forward to this GGE . Almost all of them follow the same structure and we are focusing here on qualifications . So I think that this is something to be celebrated . And these definitions follow an approach that my Delegation has consistently called for which is a focus on innate characteristics instead of technical means used in different types of autonomous weapon systems . Just like my colleague from Austria has said before , pretty much any weapon system can be made autonomous by the application of the technologies that are becoming increasingly available . So we need to focus on making them the definition that we are working on resistant to time . I also concur with Belgium and Austria regarding the qualification of the object of our work as lethal or nonlethal . Any system including those that have been explicitly designed to be less lethal can have lethal effects depending on the circumstances of their use . I would like to clarify regarding bullet 3 that our proposal has also included the element of identification of targets and also to point out that we had a similar concern to the one that has been just expressed by our representative from the civil society regarding the last bullet point . I think that the qualification of involvement of the operator can actually render this definition as paradoxical because if we are talking about intervention , then we are saying that there is a need for agency whereas if we say that an autonomous weapon system can act without any involvement , in my mind , I think it is a minimalist definition that can actually make us focus on systems that are innately prohibited . If there is no involvement whatsoever by humans in the operation of these systems , then they are fully autonomous and this is something that we have long advocated should be prohibited by international law . So I would just like to point out my preference for the formulation that involves intervention , but I am very curious to hear more about the arguments about the proposal just made on the word agency . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
SWITZERLAND,16:55:50,2024-03-04,0:05:27,"Thank you so much , Mr. Chair . We , like others , would like to thank you for the way in which we are proceeding here this afternoon . We support very much the approach that you have chosen . Thanks also to the ISU for putting this together . It is very good to work this way because it is challenging us . It is getting us out of the comfort zone of prepared statements and in that spirit , I am happy to share with colleagues a number of observations from our Delegation . Like others , I think at the outset , the most important take away here is that this way of putting these things together show us really where commonalities lie . So that is a very good starting point . Now , bullet by bullet , if you allow on the first bullet , here we would actually propose not to start with technologies but start with weapons . So basically turn this around because in our view , we should I mean , of course , it is about enabling technologies , but what we want to do here is we want to talk about technologies we want to talk about weapons based on certain technologies . That should be at the center . We have often discussed that we should not create the impression that the technologies are the problem per se . It is when the technologies are used in weapons systems in specific ways . So that is one of our first observations . Turn this around . On the second bullet , we very much like that . Once activated , that is the starting point really . On the third bullet , here we have a number of terms . We have no major problems with those terms , but we do not think all are equally important . For instance , in our view , identify is perhaps less important . It could , for instance , a target could be identified by another component of a system . Key for us really , and that is what I would like to stress , is select and engage . Also the notion of tracking seems to us not to be on the same level of importance as select and engage . On the next bullet point , this is for us the key , apply force , as others have said . Letality for us , it is not absolutely essential . It is not very useful indeed as colleagues before me have just said , including Belgium and Brazil . There is a good list of arguments on why it is not a wise approach to restrict all our work to letality . A lot of papers , a lot of contributions were made . I would also refer to the set of points put together by the state of Palestine in the response to your submission . Many of those points , they basically summarized the discussions that we had . If letality is important , we understand , of course , that is what is the key here in many ways , but it is not always the intention . We need a common understanding that letality is not a design criteria , but that is one of the effects that , of course , is of great importance . So let's keep on the table systems that are potentially lethal due to their direct or indirect effects . The next bullet without further , without direct or without concurrent , you will see in footnote 10 that this is a Swiss proposal . It probably was the result of a late night compilation . We actually are also very much okay without further control . We are not fixated on the direct control . It is probably a little bit too restrictive , thinking about it a second time here . And then , of course , the key is human intervention . And like others , we would say probably a nominal input is not enough . It has to be a sufficient human act that qualifies this as a human intervention . If we go to the concept of operator as , for instance , our colleague from the Republic of Korea has suggested , that is also possible . But in that case , perhaps we would prefer to see the addition of human . So a human operator , that would be important for us . An operator , a human operator with the ability to control . So these are just some first reactions for preliminary nature . And , of course , we are making all of these kind of in the vacuum . Of course , it depends what is before , what is after and in what context it is . Just some preliminary remarks . Thank you . Thank you very much for sharing your views .",Western European and other States,Yes
JAPAN,17:01:25,2024-03-04,0:03:55,"Thank you , Mr. Chairperson . First of all , I would like to join others to support your approach . Indeed , this is what we proposed in our general statement that the languages , those languages , most of them were seen in the Chair's last year's Chair's first draft for the substantive report . And this could be a very good basis for further discussions . And I would like to provide very preliminary thoughts which have been already addressed by my previous speakers . First , I think as for the first bullet , I agree with my immediate previous speakers as Switzerland Delegation that our focus of regulation should be not technology but it is weapons , weapon system . So I think in that way we need to improve the language . And other ones activated , I think this is no issue for us . And the third bullet , we the first proposal is identity , identify , select and engage . These languages are from our proposal , joint proposal . So we prefer those languages but we can also consider others if we can engage in more detailed discussions on what those other languages , words , technical means . And then I think the fourth bullet , deploy and apply force , I think I am not native speakers of English but probably engagement which we used in the third bullet could have similar meanings . Of course , it is not exactly the same but by continuing what the deploy and apply force exactly means in comparison with engagement , probably we can find common ground . And then the last three about human involvement , I think this is a very difficult issue and I think before I agree on how we name this point , probably we should engage more to address the content of human and machine interactions . And for Japan , it is important to consider the way to make sure that humans are involved responsibly throughout the weapons life cycle and especially that such weapon system should be used under the responsibility of the human command and control . Indeed , there is a consensus among many countries on the importance of this human responsibility . Thank you .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
UNITED STATES,17:05:30,2024-03-04,0:06:51,"Thank you , Chair . Like other Delegations , I think the first thing we wanted to say was how grateful we are that you have put this on the screen . This is exactly the kind of substantive engagement that we were hoping to see . We are seeing it on day one of this meeting and we welcome your initiative and we welcome the comments that we have heard from other Delegations so far . For anyone looking at this , I think the immediate reaction is there are very fine distinctions now that seem to separate the way Delegations are thinking about these important concepts . We are already very close but there are important issues to work through as we think about which words to choose . And so we have welcomed hearing from other Delegations about how they understand the different words , what meaning those words bring to their Delegations . Like the Delegations of Switzerland and Japan , I think it is important to understand how this definition will fit into an entire instrument and so obviously that is going to be important . What comes before it , what comes after it will be important . But we wanted to emphasize the points that both Switzerland and Japan have made that by focusing on emerging technologies is the way we frame the question and by focusing on technology in the first bullet , we may be losing sight of the need to really focus on the weapon systems themselves . Those are the objects that we have been focused on in this body . And so I think some further work on how we understand the differentiation between technology and weapon would be important . The idea of emerging is not addressed in the bullets themselves . We move straight from emerging to bullets that do not address emerging . And this Chair gets at one of the other points that you made in setting up our discussion this afternoon . For some Delegations , the importance of the definition is to identify that which must be prohibited . For other Delegations , the definition and I think for our Delegation , this is how we would think about it , the definition is something that reflects weapon systems that currently exist . And so working through that question will be important . I think for us , the idea is that we are identifying characteristics of weapon systems that currently exist that may be lawful . And so it will be important to make sure that we all have the same understanding as we move forward . Moving down the list on the bullet relating to the selection and engagement , for our Delegation , it is worth noting that identify , select and engage , those three terms have previously found consensus in this body . And so if you look back at previous reports , for example , the 2019 report , we use all three terms . And they mean different things . We appreciate that many Delegations have focused on the selection and the engagement pieces of this bullet . But the identification piece for us is an important piece to understand . What it is saying is that there is a step in which a weapon using technology could identify something that is a potential target . And the next step would be once identified to select the target . But there is an important other side of that coin , which is the ability to differentiate between things that should be selected as a target and things that should not be selected as a target . And this gets at one of the important benefits of technologies , the ability to enhance an operator's effort to distinguish between a military target and something that is not a military target . Like other Delegations , I think it is important for us to , moving to the next bullet , to retain an application of force . We are talking about lethal weapons systems . So for us , I think that would be a better way to approach it . The next bullet , without further or direct or concurrent , for our Delegation , further is clean . It is understandable . It represents a break in time . The idea of direct or concurrent involvement or intervention for us seems like something that would itself require further definition and further understanding . And so I know some of our colleagues said upon reflection they thought maybe further might be a good one to focus on . I think for us it is very precise . And with respect to the last subbullet , I think , again , we are motivated by precision to favor the intervention by an operator . It , again , gets at the human being that would actually be in charge of the system . I think some of these more generic references leave open the question of who exactly we are talking about , whereas identifying with precision that we are talking about the operator of the system for us brings a certain precision . And I know I have used the word precision several times in this intervention , but at the point at this point in our discussions , I think this is what we should be striving for as a body . We are looking to develop guidelines that will shape behavior and the most effective way to do that is to be precise . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
MEXICO,17:12:35,2024-03-04,0:04:47,"Many thanks , Chair . To begin , I would like to thank you for the way in which you have organized our discussions . And though Mexico did not present replies or was not able to offer replies to your questions and , in fact , we do have a statement to make about our position , but given that , we will now react to what you have displayed on the screen for us . Well , first off , looking at what we have on the screen , we believe that it is quite welcome that your first approach to the definitions or characterizations is not on the technical foundations of weapons , but rather your approach considers what the fundamental definitions and what the human role is vis -a-vis the weapon . And that is compatible with the position that my Delegation has had , for example , the work that we presented jointly with Chile and Brazil . As we have said before , a characterization using technical criteria would have some issues , among them the possibility that regulation could in the future be anachronical and leave out autonomous systems that would include technology that is not known today . On the second bullet point , once activated , from my Delegation's standpoint , it would seem to us that activation is an implicit consideration found in the following bullet points . We cannot have a system that can select or use force without it having been activated . What is relevant here , as we see it , it is the potential and not its activation as much . On the third and fourth bullet points , we believe that the essential functions as we have said in other opportunities where we have defined it as essential functions , the essential functions have been defined as the selection of targets , engagement , and the use of force . But at the same time , we understand that each one of these concepts has , which within it , some specific actions . But we do not believe that it is necessary to list them out , such as to identify and to track . All of these are implicit in selection as we understand it . And then on the fifth bullet , we agree with Brazil . Intervention seems to me to be the more all - encompassing term . But here what Austria said as well is worth bearing in mind . And I think that this last point , in addition to being the most critical for my Delegation and as many Delegations have said , significant human involvement , the fact remains that this is deeply intertwined with regulation , any potential relegation we might have with bands and regulations because the bands and regulations would actually be defining the specific role of humans for the weapon systems that use them . So over and above having a philosophical debate over agency or intervention or what word we are going to use , these here are the main ideas that will be established in a regulation so as to ensure that there is effective human intervention . And then on the last bullet , we agree any use of force . And lastly , to conclude and we have said this in the past , we would like to express our agreement with Belgium , Brazil and Switzerland that if this approach will be done through existing legal systems and in particular , bearing in mind international humanitarian law , then the term lethal is not one that fits within the characteristics of the use of force . The which is why we do not believe it would be of much use in our discussions . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
CUBA,17:17:34,2024-03-04,0:03:52,"Thank you , Chair . We as a country have a few ideas that we would like to share with everyone about this section on curiosity and restrictions and definitions . We will be addressing the ideas that have been presented on the screen later on . To begin , for our Delegation , an agreed upon characterization of autonomous weapons is very useful in order to fulfill the existing mandate , which is why we appreciate this approach . Our Delegation understands that this is an important issue and one that cannot be set aside . However , it cannot be used as a pretext either in order to avoid carrying out negotiations . Existing protocols within the Convention must be seen as good examples to follow . We believe that an exercise as the one we are currently engaged in with definitions and characterizations must consider completely autonomous weapons as well as semi-autonomous weapons . For our Delegation , autonomous weapons must be seen as those that act without human involvement once they are deployed . Semi-autonomous weapons for their part are to be understood as those that have human oversights , at least during the critical stages , that is for the selection and the attack of targets , as is found in the working document of our Delegation from 2016 . Military drones among other weapons with certain level of autonomy that are already being used must also be considered as semi-autonomous weapons and ought to be effectively regulated . Seizing control , responsibility and human involvement in decisions on the use of force , algorithms and controlled processes online raise fundamental ethical issues . It is obvious for our Delegation that human involvement and oversight lie at the very core of future characterizations of these systems and they determine whether or not they can be developed or not in the first place and in the second , how they ought to be regulated . It is for these reasons that we believe that to reach common understandings as part of this exercise on concepts such as significant human involvement can also be most useful in our efforts . Turning now our comments to the proposals found on the screen , we would like to express our appreciation to you , your team and the Secretariat for having prepared them . Quite preliminarily we can say that we do see merits in the inclusion of this set of characterizations of the three following points . First , the critical functions of selection and attack of targets as these are a component of the characterization that we agree with in our national capacity . Secondly , apply force as a continuance of the previous idea and an important part of significant human intervention . Third , the notion of human intervention , which is important . We believe that keeping the human component is essential were we to consider other proposals such as an operator involvement . For our Delegation , it will be important to consider a potential characterization in the context of a whole host of elements of broader instruments or measures and bearing in mind that future regulations would take these characterizations into account . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR ROBOT ARMS CONTROL,17:22:02,2024-03-04,0:02:06,"But first , we have the Representative of ICREC . I think it is now on . Thank you very much , Chair . Two points that I would want to raise . The first one actually in support of the point I think which was made by the Delegation from Austria regarding the first phrase that reads an emerging technology in the areas of laws can be characterized as . I think we may need to rearrange that because as it reads , it seems as if we are focusing just about any emerging technology from facial recognition , tech , GPS , etc. that obviously are able or can be able to enable autonomous systems and I do not think that is our intention . The suggested text there could read something like and I open course here , a lethal autonomous weapon system or lethal autonomous weapon systems can be characterized as systems that are enabled by certain emerging technologies and once activated , everything then follows . It becomes a little bit clearer that we are actually focusing on the weapon systems themselves . Then the second point regards bullet points number 3 to 5 . And there , Chair , it appears to point to the critical issue on the making of the decision to use force . In characterizing these bullet points , I would invite Delegates to perhaps relate these terminologies to international humanitarian law . In armed conflict and under IHL , what does it mean to make a decision to use force or to direct an attack ? The potential reason , Chair , why we have all these various terminologies contained in bullet point number 3 to 5 is that there is no common understanding on what is meant by making of the decision to use force . Can anything in existing IHL or other relevant international norms guide us on how we characterize these particular bullet points ? That would be my intervention . Thank you , Chair . I would like to thank you for your intervention .",Non-applicable,No
INDIA,17:24:20,2024-03-04,0:02:28,"Thank you , Mr. President . Let me begin by appreciating your efforts , the guiding questions and the various compilations that the Secretariat has produced . We are trying to capture something elusive and novel and something which has consistently outpaced regulatory efforts . At a general level , for us , the definition is related to the scope and to the obligations of the instrument and for compliance if that is applicable . For example , if we are talking of prohibitions and restrictions , does this definition apply to either prohibitions or restrictions or both ? What is it that we are a technology that meets these criteria ? Is this to be prohibited or restricted or are they different ? That is one point . My second point is that we would like to have a clearer understanding of which technologies or which weapons or which weapon systems or which effects in users of such technologies , weapons and weapon systems might be affected by a potential instrument and what would be the impact on future weapons and weapon systems ? Clarity and precision are important . We will , of course , have to study the elements carefully and come back with our detailed comments . A couple of other points . One , we have consistently said that we are discussing in this context the lethal uses of force . Second , are we talking of technologies or weapons and weapon systems ? We have also consistently said that technology should not be stigmatized . We would , therefore , at this stage indicate a preference for approaching this with the intention of identifying specific weapons and weapon systems . On the question of human intervention / control / involvement / agency , this is very difficult and we will need to study this further . We are okay with the concept of activation and with identification , selection and engagement . Thank you . I would like to thank you for your intervention .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
ISRAEL,17:26:58,2024-03-04,0:02:08,"Thank you , Chair . At the outset , allow me to congratulate you , Ambassador Hinderbosch , for assuming your duties and leading our work in the GGE . I join others in thanking you and the Secretariat for this compilation of characterizations of laws . As means of a very preliminary reaction to the different suggestions on the screen , we will offer two non-exhaustive substantive comments . First , similar to other colleagues , it is Israel's position that any characterization of laws must focus on lethal autonomous weapon systems and not just any weapon systems in line with our current mandate . Similarly , our focus should be on the exercise of lethal force by such systems as the inclusion of nonlethal force would lead to broadening the debate to encompass fields which fall outside the purview of the CCW's mandate and expertise such as law enforcement contexts . By deviating from the issue of lethality and autonomous weapons , we risk losing sight of compliance with the key aspects of using weapons under IHL , particularly compliance with targeting rules which has been the focus of our discussions in the past . Additionally , in response to certain comments , we stress that the distinction between lethal force and other types of force is a well - established distinction under international law recognized by numerous stakeholders . Therefore , we think that the lethality element must stay within our mandate . Second , any reference to the functions of identification , selection and application of force against targets should be confined to independent exercise of all these functions in order to discern laws from automated weapons that are not the focus of our discussion , for example , precision guided munitions . For the same reason , it should be made explicit that we address systems that identify , select and then engage targets . In other words , these functions are cumulative and not alternative . That is all I have for now . Thank you , Ambassador . Thank you for that .",Western European and other States,Yes
UNITED KINGDOM,17:29:30,2024-03-04,0:03:25,"Let me now first give the floor to the representative of the United Kingdom . You have the floor . Thank you , Mr. Chair . Thank you for this exercise which we join Delegations around the room in applauding for allowing meaningful discussion . Nevertheless , it is something of a vexed point to start on because it feels like yet again we are talking about definitions . So the UK would note our position and our understanding of a number of the positions in this group that the substance of our discussion actually lies less in how the system is described but rather in how the system with autonomous function might meet the requirement of IHL . We need to be clear that we are setting up a description to meaningfully guide this conversation around measures . It can not intrinsically assume a value judgment over the technology itself . If our description immediately lands on those , to use the words of other Delegations in this room , fully autonomous systems which would be necessarily banned , that is not what this exercise is about and therefore we must be careful in the parameters of our description . In terms of describing the system with autonomous functions , I would make the point to start with that there is actually no meaningful definition of a lethal weapon in IHL . A weapon is equipment designed for use to apply offensive capability which may cause injury or damage . Arguing over degrees of lethality does not really add to that description . We would agree with previous Delegations in relation to the point of this description and remember that some of the sort of measures that we have seen would be measures which include regulation of technology and some which would include regulation of the use of weapons but the focus of the conversation has been about autonomous weapons systems . The UK has been chewing over the final limb of the definition that we have up on the board and trying to work out what is meant by further and direct intervention by an operator and whether this might mean that we are inadvertently excluding semi-autonomous systems which may well benefit from being included in any sort of best practice measures . In doing so , we have alighted on the third bullet and we would ask the question of whether those points in the third bullet of identifying , selecting and engaging are cumulative or can any of these functions be autonomous to enable the system to come within our discussion . What we think the principles that this definition is starting to alight on is that we are looking at weapon systems which once activated perform some or all of the decision making functions within an engagement process such as detecting , identifying , selecting and engaging in order to apply force without the requirement for but not excluding the possibility for further human involvement . Noting that this description is not presumptive of regulatory outcome , we would suggest that a description that addresses these principles would provide the most meaningful basis of our discussion about measures that may apply in the context of weapons and include functions that allow degrees of autonomy . Thank you , Mr. Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
PHILIPPINES,17:33:08,2024-03-04,0:01:22,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . We join Delegations in expressing our support to the Chair's approach for the discussions . For the first bullet we would like to join Japan , Switzerland and the US on their opinion on focusing on the weapon systems and not on the technology . For consideration we offer the following language : Weapon systems based on technologies that enable it to so that the focus is on the weapon systems and not on the technology . Noting the explanation provided by the United States distinguishing identify from select , we express our preference on identify , select and engage . On applying force , we also join Delegations before us who said that lethal qualifier is not needed here . As the full name of the CCW indicates , weapons that are excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects should be included and not necessarily lethal . For the last bullet , this section needs to reflect that the intervention should be meaningful or significant and not mere token intervention . We are also open to further understanding the term agency . We would like also to join previous Delegations recommending adding human in the phrase intervention by a human operator . Thank you , Mr. Chair . Thank you for your intervention .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
PAKISTAN,17:34:38,2024-03-04,0:03:56,"Thank you , Chair . In line with other speakers , we would also like to commend you for the manner in which you have chosen to conduct our work which makes us engage on these important questions . So we really appreciate that opportunity . We would also like to share some comments on the questions that you have put forward on the screen , but first before some general observations on the exercise that we are engaging in in terms of definitions . I would like to recall I think it was stated by Ambassador D' Amico last year when we were engaging on this very question that the definitions are helpful as long as they are helpful . So it is important that we remain very closely tied to that thought process that if we are engaging in this exercise of characterizations and definitions , they need to be very closely wedded to the governance framework or in this case prohibitions or regulations which will be followed after this . Secondly , I think an important principle that an important parameter that we established in our previous conversations while having this discussion on characterization and definition was this technology proof nature of this conversation and that was also endorsed in the report that we adopted last year in the paragraph 20 of the 2023 GGE report . And that is why we believe that definition on physical characteristics of these weapon systems may run the risk of not being technology proof . So we support the capability and functional approach that is also in line with the existing examples of the convention and protocols in protocol 3 , protocol 4 and protocol 1 as well . Now on the questions on the bullets that appear on the screen , our Delegation also sees merit that we need to be very clearly talking about directly about the weapon systems when we try to characterize them . So in essence we can support the formulation that has just been put forward by the Distinguished Delegate of the Philippines on this count . On the issue of in the third bullet , we note that we have used in our previous reports the qualifiers , the characteristics of identification , selection and engagement of targets . So that is certainly preferable for our site . We also believe that when we talk about application of force , we do not need additional qualifiers and I think this point of view is also very lucidly put forward by ICRC in their submissions as well in terms of what kind of challenges in compliance of IHL could arise from these weapon systems that are not necessarily linked to lethality of application of force but are also needed in all other cases , for instance , in terms of causing injuries from these weapon systems . Lastly , Mr. Chair , we also favor the approach in terms of without further human intervention but as long as it is being described as a characteristic of these weapon systems . We also endorse this point of view that when we talk about the human control or the notion of meaningful human control , that is a notion that we would need to revisit in the context of prohibitions and regulations that we will address later on . But as of now , when we are talking about the characteristics , we believe that without the need of further human intervention during the critical functions of any weapon systems that could be used as a main characteristics of these weapon systems . Thank you .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
COSTA RICA,17:39:10,2024-03-04,0:01:55,"Thank you , Chair . We thank you for giving this opportunity to participate in this exercise . I would like to make some preliminary comments on this proposal . My Delegation believes that we should focus on the system's functions and the role played by operators . We may run the risk of having a definition that will be out of date if we just focus on current technology as said by many other Delegations . As my Delegation said over the last three years together with Delegations that presented draft protocol 6 , we cannot limit our discussions with the qualification of lethality . The same is not compatible with IHL . This was explained on numerous occasions by the ICRC and was supported by different Delegations as was done recently by Belgium , Austria , Brazil , Switzerland and the UK Under first bullet point we agree with Switzerland and other Delegations we have to focus this debate on weapon systems and not technologies . Now my last point on the last bullet point , we believe that human intervention is the most appropriate language but we can also look at the proposal to look at the proposals related to human agency as an option . Thank you . I would like to thank you for your intervention .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
AUSTRALIA,17:41:54,2024-03-04,0:03:38,"Thank you , Chair . The laws GGE has been discussing definitions and characteristics of emerging technologies in the area of laws for many years . There has been a tendency to go around in circles on this topic . That is why we join others in expressing appreciation for putting concrete text up on the screen that we can engage with . We share the view expressed by many Delegations in this room including in written submissions that it is not necessary to arrive at an exhaustive common definition of laws to make substantive progress and fulfill our mandate . That said , a certain shared conceptual clarity is clearly helpful when formulating elements of a future instrument on laws or indeed other measures . As you pointed out , Chair , and has been highlighted by others , different Delegations offer different definitions or characteristics of laws for different purposes . Some states propose definitions to indicate the broad range of systems that are relevant to the discussions of this group whereas other states are seeking to elaborate characteristics of laws to describe the types of laws that should be prohibited . But the purpose of the definition and where it might fit in a future instrument is critical context . But we will put that question to an aside for the moment . The draft Article's proposal that Australia cosponsored referred to autonomous weapon systems to include those weapon systems that once activated can identify , select and engage targets with lethal force without further intervention by a human operator . So the elements of a definition you have put on screen track pretty closely against this . It is our longstanding preference to refer to autonomous weapon systems instead of laws since autonomous weapons may have a range of effects including nonlethal that are regulated by IHL . Echoing the comment made by the US , the phrase "" technologies that enable "" is not necessary from our perspective . It is weapon systems that we are talking about , not only the technology that enables them . The formulations offered in bullet point 3 strike us as different ways of saying the same thing . We do not consider track to be a necessary inclusion . Indeed , arguably that narrows the definition of laws in a way that is not helpful . We understand that deploy is referring to the deployment of force which we understand to have the same meaning as apply force . We suggest that apply force is clearer to avoid any confusion with the deployment or activation of the weapon system . We would also note that apply force and engage which is noted in the bullet point before this have the same meaning and so we query whether we need both . Turning to bullet point 5 , in our view , these words , further , direct , concurrent , can be interpreted to mean quite different things . What we want to convey here is that following the activation of the oars , the weapon system is capable of doing certain things on its own and we think that the word further captures that best . For the reasons articulated by others before us , on the final bullet point , we suggest that intervention by a human operator is a more precise and useful formulation here than human involvement . Thank you , Chair . Thank you for your intervention .",Western European and other States,Yes
ICRC,17:45:42,2024-03-04,0:03:08,"Thank you , Chair . Thank you for your leadership in this exercise which we find a very useful way of drawing out substantive discussions . We support the approach taken here . We believe that characterization needs to have a broad enough scope to capture all autonomous weapons that raise humanitarian concerns and that need to be the subject of regulation and then within that scope of autonomous weapon systems , there will be some that require specific prohibitions , in our view , unpredictable autonomous weapons and those applying or designed or used to apply force against people and others for which restrictions are then needed . On the first bullet point on your text , we agree with what has been said by the Distinguished Delegate of Switzerland and then supported by the US , the UK , the Philippines , Pakistan and others regarding the need to focus on the weapon system itself and that aligns with the way in which international humanitarian law generally regulates weapons , means and methods of warfare rather than specific technologies . On the third bullet point , we share the concern raised by the Distinguished Delegate from Switzerland that not all of these functions are crucial . For us , the selection of the target is the key concept . If that is made cumulative with aspects such as identify and track , we do worry about unduly and perhaps inadvertently narrowing the scope to only systems with all of these characteristics . On the last bullet , we agree with the concept that human intervention should not be nominal . For us , the formulation of selecting and applying force without human intervention should at least be interpreted as excluding situations where a human does something nominal that does not alter those processes of target selection and force application . Finally , on the points that have been raised about any qualifier of lethality , we have consistently expressed the view shared here by Delegations including Belgium , Brazil , Switzerland , Mexico , Costa Rica , the UK and others that lethality is not a suitable characteristic to describe an autonomous weapon system and it finds no justification in IHL . IHL notably protects civilians not only against death but against injury . It protects combatants against superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering short of death . We recall that the prohibition in the CCW's protocol 4 is based on the ability of blinding laser weapons to produce those superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering effects . We would also recall that IHL protects civilian objects against material damage and destruction . So for us it is imperative that these other systems still fall within the scope of the GGE's discussions because there are crucial limitations that are necessary to govern the use of autonomous weapon systems against objects . Thank you , Chair . I thank you for your intervention and I have now Austria to be followed by Iran , China and Norway and then I think about slowly , slowly closing the list and not to already be in debt to the interpreters on the first day .",Non-applicable,No
AUSTRIA,17:49:12,2024-03-04,0:01:49,"The floor again . I think we are able to have an interactive discussion on a topic which is quite interesting and I congratulate you on your approach which has spared fruits . I think we are in a very good situation and a very good discussion . I just wanted to pick up on something that was mentioned or a question that was put into the room by the Indian Ambassador and that was also mentioned to some extent by Australia and Pakistan . I think the definitions that we are currently discussing must not be confused with any regulation or prohibitions that we have to discuss as well . And this is one point that we have made consistently over the past years that for a prohibition we do not necessarily that it is based on functions we do not necessarily need a full - fledged definition or characteristics or even technical characteristics . As mentioned before , this is also not in line with a technology neutral approach and there is also a widespread assumption among several countries that autonomy works on the spectrum . So what we are doing here is very useful but on the other hand , the definition that we are having here on the screen is not the prohibition . It is two different parts . At some point in the future we will probably focus on the prohibition and the definition will not be relevant anymore . Still , as mentioned , it is a very good discussion but the distinction between those two elements have to be clear otherwise we are getting into a too confusing debate . And one point I also wanted to make and Pakistan made it also before , we have protocols in the CCW where the definition sections describe the effects or the functioning of a weapon system but do not provide a physical description or a more detailed definition of what it is . Just to make this point as well . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
IRAN (ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF),17:51:10,2024-03-04,0:02:13,"Let me start it with we could not resolve any issue until we get familiar also with the philosophy and idea behind that . What is the model point of the laws ? Lethality or autonomy . In recent discussion there has been a tendency to focus solely on the autonomy aspect of laws often overlooking the critical lethality . Such approach overlooked the ethical and humanitarian aspects associated with the use of lethal force by autonomous weapon system . By emphasizing autonomy without consideration for lethal function of the system there is a risk of overlooking the gravity of the potential consequences . Therefore it is imperative to recognize the relationship between autonomy and lethality . Autonomy should not be divorced from its lethal implication . Rather it should be understood as the capacity of autonomy system to independently make decision that may result in lethal outcomes . This reframing ensure that discussion on autonomy are grounded in a comprehensive understanding of ethical , legal and humanitarian consideration inherent in the use of lethal force by autonomous system . Furthermore autonomy in laws must be understood within the context of their lethality . Highlighting the gravity of decisions made by the system and corresponding ethical responsibility . By recognizing the nature of autonomy and lethality policy maker could engage in more discussion and decision making process regarding the regulation and the use of laws . I remind that focusing on laws as the ultimate product and subject of regulation rather than attempting to address each and every emerging technologies contributing to their development could expedite the regulatory process and facilitate more effective decision making .

CHINA,17:53:32,2024-03-04,0:03:51,"China has always believed the discussion on the definition and characterization are extremely important . This is the basis and the key for us to promote our substantive discussion including those on the further measures to be taken . We thank the Chair for his leadership and the preparation by the Secretariat as well as the contributions by parties . As for the points on the screen , China would share the following initial comments . First , what we want to regulate are weapons systems rather than technology . So the subject should be weapon systems . Two , we need to be clear as to what we are discussing here . The definition or characterization describes what should be prohibited or not acceptable laws or weapon systems in line with the above description should include weapons to be prohibited and those weapons that are not to be prohibited . China believes the discussion on the definition and characterization should be directly related to the measures to be adopted . General discussions are not inducive to the measures to be taken . Third , the above description does not mention lethal . This is a key element of our discussion on laws . Otherwise , the discuss is autonomous weapons systems or AWS characterization and definition rather than those of laws . This is not in line with the mandate of the GGE . Fourth , considering the technology related laws are under rapid development , the process by parties to resolve the issue of definition cannot be completed at one go . Currently , the discussion on the definition should take into consideration of the future development of the technologies and avoid the definition being out of date when the moment it is made . Fifth , the killing chain of the weapon systems including several links of observation , judging , deciding and acting , certain links which have autonomous functions does not make the weapon systems lethal or indiscriminative . Certain scholars mentioned concerns should be on the capability of the weapon systems to search , discover , identify , assess , engage , track and launch force against certain targets without the human intervention . China would recommend that we can further deepen our discussions on this . China also hopes that we will receive further text from the Secretariat to facilitate our study and as well as our preparation for the discussions over the next few days . Thank you , Mr. Chair . Thank you for your intervention and you will get the text by email tonight .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
NORWAY,17:57:48,2024-03-04,0:01:49,"Thank you , Chair . The impression from listening to our discussions this afternoon is that even though we phrase ourselves slightly differently and we choose to emphasize different aspects of autonomous weapon systems at different times , we have a pretty good grasp of the sorts of systems to which we would like this characteristic or definition to apply . To our minds , we think selection and engagement probably would be very central , including probably also the application of force with the last very central element to be what is in the last bullet , however one would like to phrase it , human intervention or human involvement intervention by an operator . Of course , an important point was made earlier that you would like this human intervention to be of the right sort but introducing that sort of qualifier into a definition introduces vagueness that sometimes can lead to arguments about whether the human intervention was of the right sort . That being said , and that was the point that I wanted to make now at the end , is that it seems quite clear to me that the sort of human intervention that we are talking about is intervention related to the processes that we have indicated under bullets 3 and 4 . Now whether that proviso , that it is that sort of human intervention that we would like to talk about needs to be made explicit in the definition is a question that I would not like to answer at this time but that is something that I pose to the group for consideration . Thank you . Thank you very much for your intervention . I would like to thank you all , in particular the Distinguished Representative of the Republic of Korea who kicked off this discussion that in the end I think was a very rich discussion and often a rich discussion is sometimes not such a rich discussion but this is truly a rich discussion which we will continue tomorrow and you will be better equipped for that because we will mail you the the text for the first and second topic so you will be able to spend some time on that .",Western European and other States,Yes
