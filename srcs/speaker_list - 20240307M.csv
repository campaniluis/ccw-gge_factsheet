RUSSIAN FEDERATION,10:23:04,2024-03-07,0:07:54,"Thank you very much , Distinguished Chair . I would like to share a few comments on the question of possible mitigation of risks related to the development and employment of lethal autonomous weapons systems . At this stage we do not see any need to make any comments on the list of bullet points that you proposed because this is our first consideration of this list . And this list requires additional study at the national level and this also applies to the proposals that you presented in the form of a compilation on other questions . We believe that the main objective of our current exercise is our first consideration of the list , exchange of views and expression by Delegations of their priorities on different issues in order to give you , Chair , the possibility to identify specific ideas , proposals , potential measures that eventually could be agreed to on the basis of the principle of consensus by all Delegations . Now on the question of risk mitigation , one of the effective ways of mitigating risks , we consider the following measures . The effective management of the life cycle , organization of different types of tests during all stages of the life cycle including in conditions that will approximate real life conditions ensuring the reliability and failure safe nature of such devices , identifying the criteria of readiness , ensuring a maximum level of protection from non-sanctioned access , the relevant training of operators , priority in the use of technologies of artificial intelligence during the collection and processing of information that is necessary from providing support for decision making on military matters , continued monitoring of the functioning of such systems by operators ensuring the possibility of an emergency shutdown or finalization of any military objectives after a command is issued by the operator and excluding the eventuality that NSAs can lay their hands on these devices that may use them for malicious purposes . We are grateful to you , Distinguished Chair , for presenting partially at least these ideas that are reflected in the compilation that you prepared and we see them on the screen right now and we also see that these considerations are very close to the conclusions that the group made during its work over the past years and as far as we are concerned we would prefer to see specific language proposals be fully in line with the understandings that were reached by the group in previous years in order not to rewrite what we already did in the past and moreover we believe that some of these considerations that we are now seeing on the screen actually duplicate one another and we need to consolidate the text and perhaps merge some of these points . Some of the proposals that we discussed in years past and that still do not enjoy consensus and we do not believe that they will be enjoying consensus at any point . We believe that they can be deleted from this list in order to shorten the list and at the same time ensure that there is a better structure to the text . We agree with those Delegations that spoke before us when they said that such measures to large extent can be clustered under certain thematic issues because some of them relate to ensuring human control . Some of these measures relate to questions of ensuring control during the phase of development . Some of these measures relate to the stage of employment and moreover some of the measures that we see in this list are some represent particular cases and they are part of more general measures , generalized and comprehensive measures . We also in conclusion would like to stress that at this stage we see the value in what we are doing here in terms of considering risk mitigation issues . We see the value in determining possible general measures of such nature and in all of this we believe that specific ways or steps related to risk mitigation as part of these general measures will be left up to states to decide because states are the ones who bear the full responsibility for implementing and complying with relevant international obligations including under international humanitarian law and such measures must simply assist states , parties in ensuring this proper and effective compliance of international law including IHL . Thank you .",Eastern European States,Yes
INDIA,10:31:41,2024-03-07,0:03:45,"Our Delegation would like to address the issues of risk mitigation with regard to lethal autonomous weapons systems and the consequential risks with their development and use . Risk mitigation is a proactive strategy to identify , assess and mitigate potential threats or uncertainties to ensure that we tackle the risks with actionable steps . As technology continues to evolve , the international community will be confronted with the legal , operational and humanitarian challenges posed by the development and use of laws and the associated risks . The challenges necessitate a concerted effort to identify and implement effective risk mitigation measures to ensure that it complies with the principles of international humanitarian law and does not use cause unnecessary suffering or superfluous injuries . We agree that the commitments made by the United States with regard to risk assessment and associated mitigation with the risk could be grouped under the following heads . They were covered extensively yesterday . Unintended engagements , loss of control over a system , loss of human control , lack of human judgment , difficulty in assigning responsibility and these kind of issues could be grouped under an operational risk . Unpredictable system behavior , unpredictability , unintended inappropriate behavior of a system , reliability , algorithmic biases , AI biases , limited data selection , et cetera could be grouped under a technological risk . Deliberate manipulation by malicious actors , development , deployment and use by non-state actors , proliferation and acquisition of technology by terrorist groups , acquisition by unauthorized users could be grouped under proliferation risks . Other risks are protected by the provisions of IHL which requires for the operators to be trained extensively through capacity building and awareness programs in the manner which these weapons systems are utilized . This would ensure that the provisions of distinction , proportionality and precautionary attack are adhered to and targeting is affected only against specific military targets . Associated with these are confidence building measures and sharing of best practices that can be effectively worked out through international cooperation and diplomacy . We believe that in this area , civil societies and governmental organizations , non-governmental organizations could play an active role to work closely with the states' parties to evolve risk mitigation measures that would ensure that only legitimate targeting within the confines of IHL is undertaken through use of laws . Our Delegation underscores that risk is inherent to any environment , especially so when we talk about weapons and targeting and hence the importance of implementing robust risk mitigation measures to address the challenges posed by laws . We believe that these risks could be mitigated through already established practices which have been brought out by several Delegations , which could be realigned to suit the development and use of laws . In conclusion , we believe that by implementing the concrete risk mitigation strategies , laws can be developed and used in a manner consistent with international law . Thank you , Mr. President . I would like to thank you for your views and also , again , views on how to structure the risks we have highlighted .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
AUSTRALIA,10:35:53,2024-03-07,0:07:13,"I would now like to pass the floor to the Distinguished Representative of Australia . You have the floor . Chair , we would now like to offer some comments on each of the sub - questions under topic 3 . Turning to the first , being concrete risks with regard to the development and use of laws , we note that the GGE has been discussing risks of laws for some time now . As Delegations observed yesterday , there is a substantial amount of existing consensus language on risk in previous GGE reports that should be the starting point for our discussions on this topic . Several of these paragraphs from past consensus reports were drawn to our attention by Delegations yesterday . Over the course of past GGE sessions , different risks have been emphasized by different Delegations . My Delegation has largely been approaching risk through the lens of IHL compliance by focusing on mitigating the risk of unintended engagements and civilian harm . We think this is an appropriate we think this is appropriate in an IHL forum such as the CCW . As a general point , it is helpful to be clear on what risks relate to autonomous functions in weapons generally and which relate to specific AI technologies . Some risks listed here are uniquely related to the incorporation of artificial intelligence in weapons systems and we support the suggestion made yesterday by one Delegation to use more precise language where risk does relate to AI . For example , stating algorithmic bias in AI . We echo the observation yesterday that some of the points outlined are not risks of themselves . Rather , they are causes , consequences , or effects of risks . For example , the lack of human judgment in the design or use of a system may lead to risks of noncompliance with IHL and we think it is important to bear in mind this distinction when classifying the different risks . With respect to the first bullet point , we note that the risk of unintended engagements and loss of control of a system is a specific risk that is already been identified in previous GGE reports . Turning now to the second sub question regarding concrete risk mitigation measures with regard to the development and use of laws , we think this is an area where there is substantial common ground between GGE Delegations . If you look at the various proposals on the table , they all contain very similar risk mitigation measures . We heard yesterday suggestions on how to classify and categorize these risks and we think it would also be helpful to organize the risk mitigation measures into categories . We suggest one way of doing this could be to group them by the various measures taken at the various stages of a weapon's life cycle or the various stages of the life cycle of a weapon system . For example , risk mitigation measures to implement at the design , development and use stages . This would build on guiding principle G which notes that risk assessments and mitigation measures should be part of the design , development , testing and deployment cycle of emerging technologies in any weapon system . We also note that the GGE reports of 2018 and 2019 contain useful consensus language on risk mitigation measures . My Delegation endorses the views expressed by the ICRC yesterday on the need to distinguish legal obligations and measures to comply with legal obligations . We think this is a very important point . Several of the measures listed here are what we would categorize as IHL obligations and others are measures to ensure respect for IHL by a state's armed forces . So , for example , assessing expected collateral damage in relation to concrete military advantage would be a part of a proportionality assessment as required by IHL . We note that some of the risk mitigation measures outlined are quite vague . For example , the point on safety mechanisms , technical and organizational safeguards , et cetera , it is not clear to us what kind of safeguards or mechanisms are being referred to here . We also note that the term potential precaution could benefit from rephrasing or further elaboration as it may create confusion with the IHL obligation to take feasible precautions in attack . On the point about ensuring predictability , accountability , et cetera , we echo the point expressed by some Delegations yesterday that these are not risk mitigation measures but rather are goals or effects of other measures . We suggest risk mitigation measures should focus on the practical measures that can be implemented in order to reduce risk . Finally , we turn to the third prompt regarding concrete confidence building measures with regard to the development and use of laws . We understand confidence building measures as referring to measures that build mutual trust between states . CBMs are usually underpinned by the exchange of relevant information among states so as to clarify others' intentions , avoid suspicion and reduce misperceptions . As you , Chair , have set out in your prompt , we would like to see risk mitigation measures and CBMs as conceptually distinct . Given how we understand CBMs , we would like to see some of the actions listed sorry , we would see some of the actions listed as somewhat misplaced under this particular heading . For example , ensuring military documents and training for military personnel are updated and measures enabling after action review of a weapon system , those measures are in our view good practices for ensuring compliance with IHL by states armed forces rather than what we would typically categorize as a confidence building measure . We are of the view that the ICRC's point about the need to be clear about what measures are legal obligations and which go beyond this is equally relevant to the points listed under this prompt . We are pleased to see included in this list the voluntary exchange of relevant best practices on legal reviews and we note that this was also referenced in paragraph 23 of the 2023 laws GGE report . Thank you , Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
SWITZERLAND,10:43:19,2024-03-07,0:03:06,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . We spoke on the potential risks already yesterday but I would like to add two reflections regarding reliability and accountability . First , and this relates to the bullet points 1 to 3 regarding reliability and unintended harm , these are aspects that deserve more in - depth considerations . They are very important as harmful consequences of the autonomous weapon systems reliability and / or the way how they fail may not only raise operational issues or risks but also fundamental questions regarding compliance with IHL . For instance , what happens if the system fails ? Would it self - destruct or would it attack unintended targets that are protected under IHL ? Second point regarding responsibility and accountability , these are crucial aspects , notably also for ensuring respect of IHL . As we advocated in the past , measures , for instance , for a second tier and regulations of an instrument should be defined to mitigate that risk and facilitate accountability . In order to ensure human responsibility for decisions on the use of weapon systems , a certain degree of human control must be exerted or embedded at the appropriate stages of the life cycle of a weapon . Human control and we have heard and said that many times can be exercised in various ways throughout the life cycle , the different phases of the life cycle of a weapon and notably in the targeting cycle . Those who design and procure a system must ensure that the system can be used in accordance with IHL while those who deploy and employ an autonomous weapon system must ensure an IHL compliant use . Those actors must evaluate with particular scrutiny under what circumstances and with which parameters and safeguards a system can be employed in compliance with IHL . As a general assumption , the more significant human involvement in a specific use of an autonomous weapon system is , the easier it will be to assign individual responsibility . Those were the two points that we had on concrete risks and we will come back on mitigation measures at the later stage if that is in accordance with your plans . Thank you very much .",Western European and other States,Yes
UNITED STATES,10:47:04,2024-03-07,0:08:43,"Thank you , Chair and good morning , colleagues . Chair , I think in our interventions yesterday we addressed earlier sections of topic 3 and this morning that we wanted to focus on the questions related to confidence building measures . One initial comment is that we may want to refer to this section as transparency and confidence building measures rather than just confidence building measures . Transparency is an important dimension of what we are seeking to promote here and we would encourage using that word in the way we frame this particular set of issues . We can be flexible on this point , of course , but think it would be more in line with the way we have been addressing these issues . With respect to transparency and confidence building measures , we see this as a topic that relates to both parts of our mandate , that is a set of elements of an instrument could include elements on transparency and confidence building measures such as provisions on voluntary national reporting and information exchanges , but TCBMs could also be considered as in the other possible measures part of our mandate to address emerging technologies in the area of laws . As recognized in the final bullet of this section , the GGE itself is an important transparency and confidence building measure . I think you have heard our Delegation speak often about the inherent value in this body , the GGE and in the CCW more broadly . We view the GGE as a uniquely valuable forum to promote transparency and the international discussions on emerging technologies in the area of laws . Every state that has an interest in this topic is welcome to join the GGE's work . We also have the participation of civil society organizations and these meetings are being broadcast on UN Web TV so that people anywhere in the world can see them . There is simply no other forum like this where we have the ability to engage on these issues . Many states have used the GGE as a forum for describing their own national policies and practices , both orally during GGE sessions and in the form of written submissions . For example , the United States Delegation presented on specific weapon systems in 2018 and in 2019 . We have discussed and provided US Department of Defense directive 3000.09 on autonomy and weapon systems , included a detailed presentation last year of recent updates to this particular directive . We have provided our policies on the responsible use of artificial intelligence , namely the US Department of Defense AI ethical principles as well as US Department of Defense responsible AI strategy and implementation pathway . We also very much welcome the contributions of other states that have shared their national policy and practice . In our view , any future instrument should ensure that this forum is able to continue to engage on these issues . We are now seeing similar efforts outside of the GGE . For example , last year's UNGA resolution called on states to provide submissions to the UN Secretary General for a report that he will prepare this year that will reflect the full range of views of states and will include state submissions in the annex . We welcome this effort as something that can be very useful and very useful in supporting our work in the GGE by helping to identify areas of convergence among Delegations . The United States will be submitting a detailed report to the Secretary General highlighting relevant US practice as well as the good work being done in this GGE and we encourage all other GGE Delegations to do the same . Now , Chair , just to offer a few more specific reactions to some of the individual bullets that you have included in your paper . With regard to the second bullet , ensuring military documents and training for military personnel are updated , it would be useful to be a little clearer we think in identifying the types of documentation and training we are talking about . We assume this is a reference to ensuring that military operators are effectively trained and have the relevant documentation on the weapons they are using , but this could be made clear . That said , as noted just a few minutes ago by the Australian Delegation , it is also not clear that this is a confidence building measure and maybe not something that should be placed elsewhere . With regard to the third bullet , measures enabling an after action review of the system to assess compliance with IHL of the system , this may just be a wording issue , but we note that as the GGE is concluded in 2019 , IHL imposes obligations on states , parties to armed conflict and individuals , not on machines . Human beings who use the system rather than the systems itself are the ones who must comply with IHL . This may be a wording issue , but we want to make sure that we are not , that we are a little bit more precise . We support the fifth and the seventh bullets , establishing a nonlegally binding code of conduct to promote responsible behavior and strengthen compliance with international law and the reaffirmation of the 11 guiding principles , although I will say , Chair , the 11 guiding principles have been reaffirmed already by the high contracting parties and in our view should already be shaping the behavior of states in relation to this set of issues , but obviously would not object to a continued reaffirmation of those principles . With regard to the sixth bullet , commitment to retaining human responsibility and meaningful human control over the use of laws , we would like to explain why we do not think these are useful transparency and confidence building measures . So first , with regard to states expressing a commitment to retaining human responsibility , I think we would see this to be counterproductive . We view states and individuals as responsible for the use of autonomous weapon systems and we are concerned with this language because it suggests that responsibility is only a commitment and that , in fact , machines could be responsible . We do not think that states or individuals can use laws and thereby evade their responsibilities in this regard and so we want to be careful not to use language that would implicitly endorse this argument and undermine what we view to be existing legal principles related to responsibility . Second , with respect to a commitment to meaningful human control , my Delegation would like to note that this term has been discussed for many years in the past in the GGE . It is subject to divergent understandings . It is clearly not found consensus and my Delegation provided a working paper in 2018 that explains our perspective and discusses in detail why we do not find this to be a particularly helpful term . And because there is not consensus on this term and because it is so amorphous , we do not see a commitment to this term as promoting transparency or building confidence . So Mr. Chair , those are just some more specific reactions as well to some of these points and , again , we just want to thank you and the team very much for including this . We think this is an important part of our discussion . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
GERMANY,10:56:37,2024-03-07,0:01:06,"Before Germany is also of the view that the risks related to the development and use of laws may be seen to fall under certain categories . We are in favor of that concept . We see risks related to unpredictable system behavior , algorithmic biases , reliability which may inter alia lead to unintended biases such as on gender aspects . Adequate testing , legal reviews and adequate training for human decision makers and operators to understand the system's effect and its likely interaction with its environment are in our view key to countering these risks . Other risks may be related to a possible loss of human control , the lack of human judgment or lack of accountability . We also see the risk of development , deployment and use of laws by non-state actors . In our view , the second tier focused on regulations could address the aforementioned issues and the concept of their categorization . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
COSTA RICA,10:58:07,2024-03-07,0:02:55,"Thank you very much , Chairman . After listening closely to what has been said yesterday and also looking at what has been presented on the slide No. 3 , the developments on the development of autonomous weapon systems , my Delegation would like to state the following . Costa Rica , like other Delegations including Mexico and Switzerland , considers that the exercise of identifying the risks of the use of autonomous weapon systems and looking at ways to mitigate the effects of these is extremely relevant in order to complement the central objective of this group which is to ensure progress within international law in order to properly prohibit and regulate autonomous weapon systems . In this context , the Delegations of Switzerland and Pakistan yesterday very eloquently detailed how other instruments , for example , Protocol 5 , include measures as an annex or complementary information to the prohibitions under that instrument . My Delegation supports the consideration of this model or a similar model for the topic that we are looking at now . Another element that we think is important is the call that we have heard on other occasions and yesterday to categorize the risks inherent in the development and use of weapon systems into subgroups . Costa Rica would like to thank Austria , Pakistan and Mexico for their contributions and should like to support that proposal because this raises awareness with regard to the multidimensional aspect of the risks involved in the development and use of the systems and would allow us to look into greater depth into the specific needs to address these various categories . A year ago , my country hosted the Berlin Conference which looked at the objective of discussing how the multidimensional nature of the risks of development and the use of autonomous weapon systems is obliging us to implement a holistic approach against the challenges thrown out by the development and use of autonomous weapons . A year out from those discussions , it is very encouraging to hear that there is growing consensus around the recognition of the fact that containing the risks does not depend simply on the proper compliance with international humanitarian laws obligations nor on simply voluntary actions but rather in a legally binding instrument that contains provisions in order to contain the proliferation and use of these systems . Finally , my Delegation should like to suggest that the risk mitigation aspects also include the need to look at measures undertaken by states in the private sector with regard to the trading and transfer of these systems and look at other measures in order to prevent the deviation of these . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
BELGIUM,11:01:15,2024-03-07,0:03:42,"Thank you very much , Chair . Chair , the issue of the autonomous nature of weapons systems requires specific questions to be defined , especially looking at how this relates to IHL in terms of the use of these kinds of weapons . My Delegation should like to thank you for your questions and for having brought together the responses of the Delegations and should also like to thank the Delegations who have provided responses . Belgium should like to more specifically provide support at the following points with regard to the first question . On the first point , loss of human control , Belgium prefers the terminology loss of human control to the previous terminology given that the unintentional actions and the loss of control in the systems are included in the notion of loss of human control in general terms . As far as the second point is concerned , my Delegation supports the idea of unpredictable system behavior or unpredictability . We support that notion of unpredictability , whilst bearing in mind the discussions that we have had this week and whilst understanding that this terminology may be considered as lacking precision , I am talking about unpredictability here , we nevertheless support the first which we think covers the same concept whilst being a little bit more specific . We prefer the use of unpredictability rather than behavior to avoid the impression that a machine or system can have behavior attributed to it and , therefore , we should be avoiding anthropomorphizing weapon systems . In terms of biases , which was extensively discussed already , the use of autonomous weapon systems by the very nature of those systems involves the risks of bias and these are various types and not only attributable to artificial intelligence but especially to the developers themselves . My Delegation , therefore , prefers data biases in general given that they may be biases even when using a large amount of data so my Delegation supports the intervention made by the Delegation of Austria yesterday with regard to biases . For us , by definition , a bias is unintentional and includes , therefore , the mention of unintended bias rather than that terminological specificity . My Delegation supports the notion of deployment and use and acquisition by unauthorized users including terrorist groups . My Delegation welcomes the inclusion of a point relating to a danger to non-state actors . In particular , we would be sensitive to the last suggestion which we think integrates larger spectrum of users without going into discussions into what is and what is not a non-state actor . But it is not simply acquisition but also deployment and use of the systems by nonauthorized users which represents a risk . So deployment and use and acquisition by unauthorized users including terrorist groups is what we would support . Thank you very much , Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
IRELAND,11:05:10,2024-03-07,0:03:16,"Thank you , Chair . Throughout the process of the GGE on laws , a range of states , international organizations , civil society , academia and industry have consistently acknowledged the risks related to artificial intelligence and bias , in particular with regard to gender and racial bias . This is something which was also raised by several Delegations during our session yesterday afternoon and was likewise the subject of a side event hosted yesterday by UNIDIR , together with the permanent missions of Canada , Costa Rica , Germany , Ireland , Mexico and Panama . At yesterday's event , it was stressed that gender and other forms of biases in AI technologies go beyond technical solutions and there is a need for collective action and cooperation in this regard . As you will be aware , Chair , bias on autonomous weapons is also something that has been discussed in a range of working papers submitted to the GGE over the year . In this vein , Canada , Costa Rica , Germany , Ireland , Panama and Mexico have submitted a new working paper on the issue of autonomous weapons and bias . As our working paper notes , algorithms and related machine learning risk repeating , amplifying or contributing to unjust biases that programmers may not be aware of or that are the result of narrow data selection . Indeed , it is already acknowledged by industry and practitioners as an uncontroversial fact that human beings consciously or unconsciously encode their own biases into the programmes they write . As some experts have noted , bias is inherent in society and thus inherent in AI as well . This represents a major challenge in how we think and approach these issues both at the GGE and elsewhere and it demands substantive collective action on our part . In our working paper , we present a range of recommendations for the GGE to address some of these issues including that the GGE clearly identifies and recognizes the risk that the integration algorithmic biases into autonomous weapon poses to fundamental rights and safety . This should be done in a factual manner and the GGE should develop appropriate measures to tackle the issue . Furthermore , we recommend that the future normative framework on autonomous weapons should include a number of positive obligations and commitments with regard to bias in the algorithms used in autonomous weapons . In order to mitigate the significant risk , they pose the fundamental rights and compliance with international law . This would include comprehensive testing and reviews in order to identify and correct potential biases and rigorous documentation of the datasets used in autonomous weapons in order to enhance traceability and transparency and provide information regarding motivation , the collection process and recommended use . In conclusion , Chair , it is clear that AI technologies mirror our societies but often in problematic ways that pose notable risks if they go unchecked . We must be proactive in engaging and addressing these . We look forward to further engagement in this area during the GGE and throughout the intercessional process . The working paper has now been officially submitted and will be circulated shortly . Thank you , Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
AUSTRIA,11:09:09,2024-03-07,0:03:29,"Thank you very much . We just in a very short intervention also wanted to share some more remarks on the concrete confidence building measures that you had on the screen . If you could go back to them , that would be useful . So on this kind of list which concludes , includes quite a range of very useful parts that could be part of confidence building measures and that are definitely things that states should consult with each other , where they should exchange and where best practices , especially by those states who are advanced in technology with others who in the end will then develop weapons like this as well or might use the weapons of other states would be extremely useful . The big question in this regard or first I go into the list , I mean , we have if you look at the list , we again have let's say a different typology when we go into the different measures that have been suggested here . Some of there are classic confidence building measures and we appreciate that many Delegations have taken an effort to look into confidence building measures that relate to new technology and to AI in general . There's definitely something to be done there . But there are other measures that are again more or less measures to address risks and not necessarily confidence building measures such as the second one or the third one . This is a problem that we had the whole week but just to point it out and it is not necessarily bad . Those are definitely all the measures that are necessary but rather than general recommendations . The bigger questions that when we are looking at this list and confidence building measures is what to do with them . There are different possibilities and at some point we might also have to discuss them . Once again , a disclaimer maybe that we think that the elements of an instrument are more important than this part but then again there is also the option and I have hinted at yesterday if we adopt the protocol that we follow the example of existing protocols such as protocol 5 and that we include a technical annex that has recommendations , useful recommendations to states that are more of a general nature or here go into maybe a confidence building area . Of course , there are also other possibilities and we note that some of these recommendations when it comes to confidence building are rather broad and they might also have their place in other contexts such as the Re- AIM process or the political declaration which are both looking quite heavily in these parts . It might also happen that this not necessarily ends up in the TGE laws but in another process . It could also be part of a report by the TGE and then be used somewhere else but as I have indicated at the beginning , this is a question . It is an interesting and definitely necessary part if you could look at the broader regulation or broader way of addressing the risks and share confidence building measures but the question is where will it end up in the end ? We have no preference at this point but it is something to keep in mind . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
SWITZERLAND,11:13:08,2024-03-07,0:05:07,"Thank you , Chair . As mentioned from my colleague before , we would like to add some points to risk mitigation . So as we said yesterday for Switzerland , it must be our priority to develop the contours of prohibition and regulations with respective measures . Risk mitigation for us cannot be instead of clear regulations . Risk mitigation measures should be specified as a means to comply with the overall obligations of a future instrument . Such measures can be seen as an appropriate throughout the life cycle of the weapon system . Now in terms of substance , we welcome most of the risk mitigation measures on the screen and we consider especially measures such as weapons reviews according to Article 36 , adequate training of personnel , the understandable human machine interfaces and controls and effective life cycle management as well as the establishment of doctrines and procedures for the use of automated weapon systems as pertinent . For instance , risk assessment should be an integral and standardized part of the life cycle management process . The risk assessment should factor in both the risks associated with the use of a weapon and the system's intrinsic risks such as its predictability . Risk assessments shape not only such elements as the deployment doctrine and training but also the testing regime to ensure the required levels of predictability . In this regard , the autonomous functions of a system must be thoroughly taken into account in the risk assessment and factored in when developing risk mitigation measures . States should be encouraged to adopt and further develop set of principles and policies related to autonomous weapon systems at the national level and to openly communicate about these activities . Let me briefly comment on some legal reviews . While not the sole solution for the challenges associated with increasing autonomy in weapon systems , legal reviews are a crucial instrument and thus can be part of the solution . A well - designed weapon review mechanism has not only the potential to determine whether or not an autonomous weapon system is designed in a way that it could be employed lawfully . According to Article 36 , a weapons review should state whether a weapon would in some or all circumstances be prohibited under applicable international law . By clearly defining the circumstances under which the employment of a given off would be unlawful , it becomes apparent what measures need to be taken in order to enable the users to comply with IHL . Weapons reviewers , therefore , should also be empowered to impose measures to implement IHL with regards to the weapon system on the review . Such measures could be the drafting of weapon specific regulation or training requirements . In Switzerland , our standing practice is the legal clearance of a weapon can be subjected to conditions if necessary , meaning the next step in the procurement process can only be reached once these conditions have been fulfilled . As an example , a weapon could only be introduced into the armed forces once the weapon specific regulation containing the necessary rules to implement IHL is in force . In view of the complexity of autonomous weapon system , for instance , the way they interact with the environment or functions such as machine learning , the authority responsible for the review of weapons must take into account the specific challenges arising from greater autonomy . Among others , there is need of a sound understanding of the parameters of an autonomous weapon system , its functioning and impact . Moreover , the weapon reviewer may require specific technical expertise and / or advice to conduct its review . In this regard , getting access to the information necessary for making the assessment is of paramount importance . This in turn may require a close collaboration with industry or exporting countries . Other helpful measures to overcome these challenges include rigorous testing and evaluation , as well as the review and reassessment of any possible changes and modifications in the systems functioning . I thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,11:18:28,2024-03-07,0:12:08,"Thank you very much , Distinguished Chair . The Russian Federation considers confidence building measures as an important tool for increasing trust between states' parties in connection with lethal autonomous weapon systems and the different aspects that relate to this category of weapons . In light of the existence of current norms of IHL , it is crucially important to have these tools in order to understand better on one hand the very nature of such weapon systems because we are very often talking about a weapon system that does not really exist . And on the other hand , it is also very important this tool is very important in order to give states' parties the possibility to exchange information about the steps that are taking in this area . This is why we would like to also point out the fact that such measures should be voluntary in their nature and should be nonintrusive . These are the facts that are , in fact , inherent in the very nature of confidence building measures . Otherwise , we would be talking about something else . Now , on the list of potential confidence building measures that you presented to us , Distinguished Chairperson , we would like to especially highlight the exchange of best practices and information about these weapon systems . And just like several previous speakers , we also believe that the GGE in its itself represents a format or a platform for implementing such confidence building measures in terms of exchanging information and views related to the different steps that states are taking in this area . And the Russian Federation did take relevant efforts here in the GGE to provide information both related to the modernization of the relevant national legislative base and also provide information about different military means with a high level of automation and the different technologies that are used by the Russian Federation both in terms of ensuring compliance with international obligations that are applicable to these weapons systems or to this area . And also in connection with the technical parameters that are inherent to such systems of weapons . We also would like to make several comments on the bullet points that you presented to us , Distinguished Chair . On bullet No. 2 , we believe that this bullet point is not really fully in line with the nature of CBMs because it presumes a certain interference in the internal affairs of states' parties . It is somewhat intrusive . And in fact , in some way it dictates the states' parties how they should be strengthening their national military doctrinal base related to such weapons systems We all understand very clearly that any improvements of national doctrine in military issues relates to questions of practical necessity and advisability and different countries have different practice in terms of improving such guiding documents and the types of documents moreover that enshrine relevant provisions also are different in their nature . And here we believe that it would be better to let states themselves decide issues related to this particular bullet point and we also have to realize that such a process applies also to other weapon systems . Now on bullet No. 3 , here we also believe that this bullet point , that it does not really comply with the nature of confidence building measures because here we are talking about some form of verification in terms of compliance with the norms and principles of IHL , something that is not really even provided by IHL . IHL does not refer to that . And here we believe that it would be important here to say that the main factor in terms of assessment of compliance with IHL is related to the questions of responsibility that both states and specific individuals have . And relevant international mechanisms already exist that can be used by states if they find that some other state is not in compliance with the principles and norms of IHL . We believe that here there is an attempt to present the category of laws as some type of exclusive group in comparison to other weapon systems and we do not see any need for that , especially since we are talking about some form of confidence building measure here . Now on bullet No. 5 , we think that here once again we are not really talking about confidence building measures but rather a proposal by a group of states to establish some type of code of conduct for so - called responsible behavior in this given area . As far as we understand , this previously was never presented as confidence building measures but if that were indeed the case , we would like to receive relevant clarifications from states that are promoting this idea in order to have a better understanding what specifically does this proposal mean . In any case , we would like to say that we do not find it advisable to establish or develop such a code of conduct in connection with this type of weapon systems and we consider this proposal as one of the options that were agreed by the group as a possible option to impose regulations on this weapon system . They are still on the table , all of these options are on the table and they all enjoy equal importance in the context of the functioning of this group and any of those options could be chosen by states' parties as the best possible way to regulate such types of weapons . On bullet number bullet point number 6 , once again we would like to point out that for us the notion of meaningful human control is something that is problematic . This notion does not have any legal force behind it and it creates significant problems in terms of regulating the relevant types of weapon systems . We are in favor of ensuring human control in general without any exceptions in terms of whether it is meaningful or not meaningful and without separating or highlighting any critical functions of weapon systems over which such control should be exercised and putting aside any other functions where such human control may not exist . In this question we refer ourselves to the guiding principles that were agreed to by all states' parties that clearly state that human control should be exercised during all stages of the life cycle . On bullet point number 7 , related to the guiding principles and the need to reaffirm those guiding principles once again , we would like to understand better this proposal and would like some clarifications because we believe that the guiding principles have already been approved by states' parties . They remain in force and they are something that we should use in our work and as far as we are concerned we would like to say that Russia is fully committed to the guiding principles in our activities in this sphere and we will stick to the provisions of the guiding principles in our work . Thank you very much , Distinguished Chair .",Eastern European States,Yes
CANADA,11:30:55,2024-03-07,0:02:04,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . My Delegation has asked for the floor to thank Ireland for presenting the working paper on addressing bias in autonomous weapons including in particular as algorithmic bias relates to gender . There was no question as to the importance for Canada to support the paper . As we heard yesterday from the panelists on the gender side event which Canada was also pleased to cosponsor , the question of gender in AI and indeed in military automated applications is not a fringe discussion to our deliberations here but indeed it is important to the discussions on laws specifically in the context of biases . Mr. Chair , Canada recognizes that maintaining international peace and security requires an inclusive approach that considers the perspectives of all persons and that gender balance and gender considerations have a positive impact on decision making processes related to nonproliferation , armed controls and disarmament issues at large . As we all know , it is not enough to simply have more women in the room . We must continue to recognize that biases including gender biases at the development stage of a weapon system can affect different populations and identities in different ways including women and gender diverse individuals . We would also like to acknowledge the wealth of research and data produced by international organizations in the field of gender biases in automation in weapon systems . We welcome the work and research from these organizations such as the reports produced by UNIDIR and believe international organizations have a pivotal role in our discussions within the GGE on this topic . Canada is pleased to be providing support to UNIDIR's gender and disarmament programs in the area of conventional weapons and ammunition . This support provides an opportunity for UNIDIR to explore greater connections between disarmament and gender equality across all disarmament fields . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
SWEDEN,11:33:09,2024-03-07,0:04:36,"Thank you , Chair . Allow me to voice our appreciation for the work that you have done and your team has done in collecting states' responses to this and other questions . We believe that the list indicates that we need further discussions on which risk reducing measures should be included in Tier 2 of a future instrument . First , Sweden wishes to reiterate that we consider that preserving human control over the use of force is a key objective and measures to ensure that human control is maintained should be considered throughout the entire life cycle of a weapons system . Weapons systems may vary greatly depending on their characteristics , operational context , target , spatial and temporal limits . As such , the level of human machine interaction may also vary greatly and its limits must be taken into account . The specific measures required for human control will thus need to be context dependent and assessed on a case - by - case basis . Second , many risk mitigation measures may be addressed through responsible development of new weapons systems , legal reviews , instructions and training of relevant personnel . At this point of the discussion , we would like to highlight legal reviews and training and instruction and dissemination of IHL . As other delegations have mentioned , state parties to addition protocol 1 are obliged under Article 36 of the protocol to determine whether the employment of a new weapon , means or method of warfare , including those with autonomous functions would in some or all circumstances be prohibited by applicable international law . This is also referred to in the GGE guiding principles . In this context of laws , the legal analysis foregoing the determination required by Article 36 of the addition protocol 1 should include aspects of human machine interaction and the ways in which they are addressed in manuals and training programmes . We welcome the fact that more states now share information on how they implement Article 36 of the additional protocol 1 and we support initiatives on exchange of best practices on procedures and methods for legal reviews . We also welcome increased transparency such as voluntary exchange of information when this is appropriate . We would also like to refer to the important work CIPRI has done on laws and IHL as well as laws and Article 36 which may be useful for this group's further work . As regards to training and instructions , this group stated in 2023 report that states should provide appropriate training and instructions for human operations . States should ensure that humans have sufficient assurance that laws once activated act in a foreseeable manner in order to determine that such systems may be used in conformity with applicable international law and the intentions of commanders and operators . Developers , commanders and or operators must have a sufficient understanding of how the weapon systems at their command operates on their effects and likely interaction with its environment . It is therefore essential that they have the necessary tools at their disposal to perform their duties correctly . Laws needs to be sufficiently predictable and reliable so that they allow for the operator to be certain that the systems will function in accordance with the operator's intentions . Risk assessment and corresponding mitigation measures are part of the development of all advanced weapon systems . The process of procurement , maintenance and use of such systems should be controlled by elaborate safety procedures . The procedures should be documented in handbooks on safety from different perspectives ranging from questions about explosives and ammunition to software quality . And it is essential that complex systems have rigorous handling regulations including manuals , procedures of use and methods of training . I thank you , Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
BELGIUM,11:37:54,2024-03-07,0:05:17,"Thank you , Chairman . Chair on risk mitigation measures , my Delegation should like to recall guiding principle E of the GGE in favor of the universalization of the legal review of all weapon systems including autonomous weapon systems as early as possible in terms of the development or acquisition of weapon systems in line with Article 36 of AP1 in the Geneva Convention as the Swedish Delegation just recalled the examination of lawfulness should in our opinion be renewed if there are any significant changes made to the weapon in terms of its essential functions or indeed its effects . That is particularly important with regard to autonomous weapon systems because these systems may include machine learning or automatic intelligence capacities . For my Delegation guaranteeing the compliance with international law including IHL and its fundamental principles of distinction , proportionality and precaution means evolving clear standards and guidelines in terms of design and human behavior with regard to the deployment and use of these systems whilst highlighting maintaining meaningful human control but also in terms of responsibility and accountability throughout the life cycle . These requirements may include but are not limited to limits on the type of target that the system can engage , limits on the duration , the geographical scope of the use of the weapon system , clear procedures to guarantee that the commander and the human operators are properly trained and informed about the system and that their behavior and their effects and requirements with regard to the interaction between humans and the machine and the intervention and deactivation at an appropriate time if necessary as well as test procedures , certification and rigorous validation procedures , requirements with regard to safe registration systems as well as limits on the capacity of the weapon system to in live times implement aspects in its critical functions . Whilst taking into account the position my Delegation should like to provide its support to the following points that you highlighted in your document . Rigorous testing and evaluation . We think it is not only about undertaking tests but also being able to undertake evaluation and assessments with regard to the results of these tests . We think the first version of this point is more specific and precise . My Delegation also supports the mentions of script qualifications assessment validation procedures and , of course , legal reviews whilst maintaining the fact that these issues relating to lawfulness look at all weapon systems including autonomous weapon systems and their particularity should be once again applied to each amendment or modification made to the weapon system . My Delegation also supports the question on adequate training of personnel . Education in international humanitarian law is also recommended by my Delegation for any deployment and not only that including autonomous weapons but also semi-autonomous weapons . Appropriate engagement in another point from my Delegation appropriate rules of engagement encapsulates the following proposal on the same point . In terms of biases , the question has already been examined during the risk - related issues but my Delegation would support that the proposals that have been used here to reduce bias and unattended bias is probably that which would enjoy our support most in terms of data biases . This might be more beneficial if it is generic and would avoid specifying those biases or unintentional biases that we already mentioned previously . Finally , Chairman , although for Belgium the adoption of an international legally binding instrument looking to prohibit and regulate autonomous weapons systems is necessary , my Delegation nevertheless thinks that national legal reviews are the best way to fully implement the obligations contained in international instrument whether it be binding or not at a national level . In terms of the following up the various elements contained within an instrument that may be adopted by the high contracting parties of the CCW , it would be possible to establish a mechanism to exchange good practices and the challenges thrown up during the review . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
AUSTRIA,11:43:41,2024-03-07,0:01:56,"I have to apologize for taking the floor again on the same topic but there was an omission on our side on one of the bullets that we are also seeing on the screen under the confidence building measures which is the one about establishing a non-legally binding code of conduct . First point is that this is , of course , not a confidence building measure . So it does not really fit under this topic or under this question . The second point and we also have outlined this a little bit in our working paper is that this also does not really fit under the purpose and the task or the mandate of the CCW which is to establish prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects . The structure of the CCW is a framework convention which operates through legally binding protocols in combination with its general provisions . So we are having some problems to see where the place of such a non-legally binding instrument would be . More or less we would produce it and we have to lay it aside which is not a very nice thing to do . And there are also some other problems with regard to financing and follow - up measures and who would actually take care of that . So there are some legal problems and some practical problems as well . Having said this , there is , of course , the chance that this might be a side product that comes from our work on a legally binding instrument and as mentioned before could be part of some technical annex or some additional elements of a protocol but this is more or less something that we have to see for the future . Main point of my intervention is that we are having a problem or a hard time to see how a non-legally binding instrument would fit into the CCW . Thanks .",Western European and other States,Yes
PAKISTAN,11:46:21,2024-03-07,0:07:36,"Thank you , Chair . On the topic of confidence building measures , we share also the same view to first address the broader place and context of CBMs in the work we are doing . One way is , of course , that we look at the examples of existing Convention and the protocol as well which the mandate also demands us to do . In that context , what we shared yesterday , that for us , we can certainly look at certain sharing of best practices , additional measures that could help in implementation of the obligations that are contained in the protocol of the Convention . In that context , the technical annex of protocol 5 is a very suitable example in that regard . When we are engaging in the process of confidence building measures , we need to also be mindful of the view of how this would fit in the broader outcome that this group would generate in realization of our mandate . Then on the contextual , on the philosophical question of CBMs , what are they meant for ? We believe that they are very useful . They have the potential to contribute significantly to enhancement of peace and security as we have been doing in following in various other examples . I would also agree with my Distinguished Colleague from Russian Federation who said that they are useful to promote trust among states' parties as well . So if these broad objectives are to be kept in mind while we delve deeper into the work of this group , we believe that our path is laid out very clear in terms of what is contained also in the Convention itself , including in the preambler and the work that we have been doing previously on this topic in the past DGEs . When we look at the preamble , it is very clearly stated there desire to contribute to international the ending of the arms race and the building of confidence among states and hence to the realization of aspiration of all peoples to live in the peace . Similarly , we have also recognized the importance of pursuing every effort which may contribute to progress towards general and complete disarmament . So these broad and somewhat very idealist ambitions should be kept in mind while we engage in the work of confidence building . Mr. Chair , if we look at the previous work that the GGE has done in the past on this topic , especially in the context of risks and challenges which have been highlighted , in 2019 GGE's report , a lot of progress was made on this topic . In paragraph 25A of the 2019 GGE report , I would like to just read out a few sentences where Delegations and I quote Delegations raised a diversity of views on the potential risks and challenges posed by laws including in relation to harm to civilians and combatants in armed conflict in contravention of IHL obligations , exacerbation of regional and international security dilemmas through arms races and the lowering of threshold for the use of force . Proliferation , acquisition and use by terrorists , vulnerability of such systems to hacking and interference and the possible undermining of confidence in the civilian uses of relating technologies were also raised . Unquote . So in order to address those challenges which were raised back then in 2019 , the GGE agreed on a couple of guiding principles which addressed part of the problem that has often been highlighted . If we look at the GGE guiding principle F , we note that the risks relating to acquisition by terrorist groups or proliferation or the physical security related risks , they have been captured in that guiding principle . However , the other areas which have often been raised which are contained in the spirit of preamble has not been addressed so far in our work and we believe on which we need to build further . When we were negotiating the report of last year's GGE 2023 , there was a section on risk mitigation and confidence in building measures which had some very useful ideas until the very end when we had to get rid of most of the text because of paucity of time . I think those ideas are also worth looking into . And here I would suggest that in the last section of that draft report , the two notions that were very useful that were contained should deserve this group's consideration . The first is that possible measures to enhance transparency and predictability could include the provision of technical specification of weapon systems and explanations of the decision making processes and procedures . So the explanation and the more information on how the decisions are arrived at the critical functions of those weapon systems , this is also in our view one of the TCBM . Secondly , when possible , building confidence could also include the establishment of an open ended dialogue and coordination among states , academic and research institutions , industry , civil society and international organizations . We take note of the point expressed by many colleagues today that the work being done in the GGE provides that venue as well and we are fully supportive of that . And I think there is merit in reaffirmation of the relevance of the GGE in that context . However , in our view , most importantly , we need to also include here measures that could enable considerations of possible effects of the development , deployment and use of these weapon systems on regional and global security and stability , including thresholds for armed conflicts . We believe that these considerations should form part of continuous assessment that is conducted by Member States . We note , for instance , that the third bullet on the screen , we are referring to measures for assessing compliance with IHL . We believe similar measures are required to also assess the risks relating to stability and security and thresholds for the use of force that should always be kept in mind in our work . And lastly , the point also made by some colleagues of ours , that we also would like to see and distinguish between the measures which could form part of our commitments and obligations as we move forward and measures that could just inform how to implement those commitments as well . And some of these measures on the screen relating to , for instance , human control , we believe that deserves a place in the obligations that this group would be developing in the course of our work . Thank you .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR ROBOT ARMS CONTROL,11:54:37,2024-03-07,0:02:43,"The floor is yours . Good morning . Thank you very much , Chair . Just one perhaps comment on confidence building measures . Perhaps the preliminary question that we may want to pause is whose confidence is being built when we are referring to these confidence building measures ? I ask this question particularly because the impact of laws in terms of the risks that we are identifying do not necessarily impact everyone in the same way . What we mean by this , the risks or how they relate to those who are building laws , those who will be using laws and those who will be on the receiving end of these particular laws are different . So the question then of whose confidence is being built becomes very important . In this particular regard , it is important at least in our view that when we are talking of confidence building measures , the measures that we discuss are inclusive of all individuals or all stakeholders will be affected . So the question of inclusivity in this particular regard is very important as part of confidence building measures . Now , when we are talking of inclusivity , in our view , this should not only begin after the weapons have been deployed or are now being used , but also including now as we are discussing policies on laws . As a question , Chair , just a look on the , for example , the names of stakeholders or states on the screen when we are discussing , you can see the dynamic in terms of who has been participating actually in this process and what this will mean in the future in terms of building confidence in in regulation of these systems . Lastly , Chair , I wanted to also raise a note on the question of specifying risks than being general when we are talking of risks . The importance of this is that there are certain risks which we need really to be concrete about . We have heard some stakeholders , for example , suggesting that we need to be general when it comes to risks such as bias . We believe that that approach perhaps is not that effective because inclusivity , there are certain issues that concern certain stakeholders that we need actually to be more concrete . Thank you very much , Chair . I would like to thank you for your comments . I just look around . Yes .",Non-applicable,No
ESTONIA,11:57:44,2024-03-07,0:01:12,"Thank you , Chair . I would like to react to the comment made related to the non-legally binding contract as it was a proposal made by Estonia . We would like to emphasize that this should be seen as a supportive measure , not a substitute to a legal instrument as we are still in a position that the international law including IHL is applicable to laws . We believe that IHL is a robust legal framework which is capable of governing new weapons technologies . Shortly about the non-legally binding code of conduct and the idea behind it , we believe it is a good tool to promote responsible behavior and strengthen compliance with international law . We believe that this would help shed more light upon any uncertainties about interpretation and application of existing law and it might cover mechanisms by which the reliability and predictability of weapons systems can be insured and assessed . It could also assist states in conducting legal reviews or reviews of weapons systems that have autonomous functions .",Eastern European States,Yes
UNITED STATES,12:46:04,2024-03-07,0:01:51,"Thank you . Thanks , Chair . Well , I am not going to kick it very far because I did want to just weigh in on the very last point that you made which is more of a how we organize point and maybe this gives people a little bit more time to really break the ice and kick it off . But I think for our Delegation , for many Delegations , this has been an incredibly rich discussion and we have welcomed the way you have managed the discussion in the room . But just as a way of Delegation management , at least for us , having materials a little bit earlier can help . It can help us prepare for more detailed reactions and we would really welcome having your notes for what you have just presented because you have offered us four very sort of complicated and detailed questions that we want to reflect on and really give you the kind of answers that these questions deserve . But also with respect to the engagements that we have had earlier in the week , I think it is always good to get us off of our talking points which you have done very successfully and I think we have just had lots of extemporaneous engagements and probably as interactive a discussion as we have ever had in this room . So that is something that we definitely want to continue . But there is a balance and having an ability to focus and engage and for some Delegations that includes engaging with capitals I think can also be quite helpful . So anyway , I am not sure I kicked anything off but just wanted to register that thought . Thank you . No , of course . But this is also very helpful and you have my full understanding . But I would say it takes two to tango because we are also driven by , of course , what we get from you . And it started , of course , by nominating the Chair . That took a little bit more time than normally . So I came in later than normally would have been the case . We started immediately with preparations but we had to do , of course , also some homework and , of course , we came up at a certain moment with guiding questions and we asked for reactions and that I am also fully aware that we gave you a very short time spent to react but we could not offer you more because , of course , we also promised to create for your convenience a compilation and we needed also this compilation for our own work to do on the guiding questions . This is a bit of a chicken and egg discussion . The good news , of course , is it is now March . Our next meeting is in August . So that is already five months . That is a lot more time than we had between the moment that I got the confirmation from the CCW ISU to be the lucky person to Chair this meeting . So we will do backward planning to give you more time . This is not only a promise . We will do that . And we will continue working in the meantime . But I , for my side , really would then also urge the room and the Delegations that we come with deadlines . We have a reason for having those deadlines because they are very pertinent to the further work we have to do . And , of course , there is always there are differences because we have also to do with very small Delegations . We will do our utmost to be in contact with everybody and facilitate everybody so he or she can be well prepared for the next meeting . And also if you want to have a more interactive discussion , of course , this is also what we are creating now . We had to take some time because we would like we really have taken I think we have taken into account what you have been saying earlier in the week and then reflect on that and then come up with the text . Well , that took us until 12 : 28 . But still , the short version of my answer to you is yes . And I also count on the high contracting parties that we make this a joint effort . Also because we know that we will then indeed enjoy this discussion in the room where people can come prepared and we really can have this interactive discussion and see where we can create more convergence .",Western European and other States,Yes
AUSTRIA,12:51:15,2024-03-07,0:03:05,"Thank you very much and also from our side we think that discussions that we had last week were due to their interactive nature and a little bit the freedom that we had from not having too concrete discussion was quite fruitful and substantial and helpful . Of course , it could have been a little bit more democratic to have broader views of states on board which sometimes comes with a different level of experience in these debates . But this is just a little side note . About your questions that you have put to us , the more concrete questions , I mean , the first one was if we still want to discuss the definition and characteristics topic . For us it is no priority but we know that it is for others . So and we are still in a process with that is quite broad . So we could still have this also in our plan . We are having not a concrete veto against it or something . What other topics should be discussed ? We note that there are two concrete topics that we have not discussed in depth this week and these are , of course , ethical considerations and the topic of accountability and responsibility and those are two that are still important . On the other way forward or in a general way , as I mentioned , the questions have been useful but what has also been mentioned that there have been some previous submissions by states , for example , by the G15 but also the US paper that were not included in this kind of text on the screen , also our working paper and others that are coming from previous years that would have been very relevant in that regard . I do not think that they should be included in this text and that we have another go at it . It would be rather good to have at some point something of more concrete text and I note that you have an excellent team that I think has the capacities and maybe also the capacity to present to us something like this . So it would be very useful to work on in the next phase while taking into account the limitations of an intersessional period to also work already on elements in the form of elements with a more to some extent also a broader textual environment that gives the different elements more context than it was possible with the questions , if this makes sense . Those are our few comments on that . Thank you . I am not going to twist your arms and certainly not stand in between you and lunch . So I will adjourn the meeting . In the meantime , we make sure that you have the text . So you have something to chew on in both ways . And then we meet again at 3 o'clock and I look very much forward to hearing your views then on what we do . We already have it circulated or it is being it is being done now . It is going out now . So if you have any problems with receiving it , please let us know and we will try to figure out how to make sure you get the text to facilitate a good discussion in the afternoon . Looking very much forward to that . I wish you a pleasant lunch and see you later . The",Western European and other States,Yes
