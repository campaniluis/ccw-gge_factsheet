AUSTRALIA,15:22:04,2024-03-07,0:04:52,"Thank you very much , Chair . And we just wanted to start by reiterating our appreciation . This has been a very productive and interactive discussion . So we are very grateful for all the efforts of your team and yourself . One point we would certainly fully endorse is the need for building on existing consensus laws , GGE language . I think we have heard that from a couple of Delegations . While the mandate of this particular GGE is different from previous years , we need to be building on work this GGE has previously done and not reinvent the wheel . We have a wealth of previous existing language we can draw on , particularly in the area of characteristics but also risk and risk mitigation measures . One practical way of ensuring we build on existing language at the August session might be to consolidate previous consensus language on the relevant topics in advance of the session . The 2022 joint proposal which Australia cosponsored attached an annex which sought to consolidate and organize previous GGE conclusions in this way . So that may be of some assistance . Another one of your key takeaways was that reaching a common understanding of laws is in the eyes of many in the room linked to the types of measures this group would agree . I think we would frame this point slightly differently and that is that Delegations have approached the discussion on definitions and characteristics with two different purposes in mind . Some Delegations have been focusing on describing laws they consider prohibited or that should be prohibited and others refer to laws as an umbrella term for all weapon systems with autonomous functions that might be referred to in an instrument , whether they are prohibited or not . As long as Delegations continue to approach the discussion on definitions and characteristics from those two different starting points , I think it will be difficult to agree a common conceptualization of laws . So one solution to this would be to separate out those two different discussions . We think that understanding the scope of any future instrument , that is what weapon systems are covered is an important first step . And once we have a shared understanding of weapon systems that are within scope , we would be better placed to have the normative discussion that is on the laws that would be prohibited or regulated . We would also like to offer some comments on your observations about application of IHL . I think your observation was around the need to clarify if lack of compliance with IHL comes down to how the weapon is used , if it is based on context of use and if it is based on the capabilities of the weapon system itself . We think the question of how IHL regulates weapons is probably not in dispute . Under IHL some weapons are per se prohibited because of certain inherent characteristics and other weapons that are not prohibited per se are subject to limitations in the way they are used and the same would hold true for laws . But as you have noted earlier this week , Chair , there is a very substantive difference of views on how to conceptualize the two - tier approach . For some Delegations the two - tiers are based on prohibitions and limitations that exist under existing IHL and there is a desire to clarify how those prohibitions and limitations apply to laws . And for other Delegations there is an interest in seeking new prohibitions and limitations that go beyond existing IHL . This week we feel we have been working well to clarify how existing IHL applies to laws and we think that continuing this work in a methodical way is a really critical first step . In your key take - aways , Chair , you referred to the conclusion of the 2023 GGE report that laws must not be used if they are incapable of being used in compliance with IHL . And along similar lines to what you proposed we see merit in building out this understanding by clarifying what would make a laws incapable of complying with IHL . And just to be clear , we are not talking about simply restating existing rules of IHL , but extrapolating measures to ensure compliance with these rules . Thank you . Thank you very much for this extensive reaction and a very well - spent lunch break , I would say . Thank you for that . Do I have already any ? Not yet . Who would like to follow up after Australia ?",Western European and other States,Yes
FRANCE,15:27:42,2024-03-07,0:03:09,"Thank you , Chairman . I just wanted to extend my thanks to you for the outstanding discussion that we have held up to now . Thanks , that is , to your guidance . And I think it is very promising for what is to come and we very much hope that this constructive atmosphere is going to continue under your guidance . Now , with regard to the document that you shared with us and the explanation , we should just like to recall that the document that you shared with us and the explanation , we should just like to recall with regard to all of the very constructive and rich discussions that have taken place that it might perhaps initially be necessary to create some kind of compilation of these different discussions , whilst on the one hand distinguishing the different elements that have already been agreed on because a number of Delegations have , in fact , intervened to say that there are a number of different elements that have been supported in the previous reports , so the 11 guiding principles , for example , and all the elements that contained within our previous work and , indeed , the new elements that may enjoy convergence and , indeed , the other elements that are still under discussion under another document that would be a status as a working document which would not prejudge any future negotiations but which would allow the Delegation to have their own view of the matter and to have their own view of the work and the work of the Delegations in the future . So we would like to ask really to appreciate the richness of the discussions that have taken place over this week . Now , in your question on addressing new topics or concentrating on the first questions that we had addressed , we think we need to address this sequentially , so the STOC taking work on the first questions which allows for a more holistic view on the view of our community on the discussions that we have had and that we have looked at this week . That is necessary . And we think we need to have a very clear view of what points of convergence and divergence there are and what has already been achieved and what is new . And then once we have that documentation , then we could then look to proceed to opening up new issues , but opening up new issues without already having that previous background , I think , would mean that we may risk losing ourselves in some way if we open up many new subjects before we close previous subjects . So perhaps we need to act in a sequential manner here . So that is what I wanted to say , Chairman , on behalf of my Delegation . Thank you very much .",Western European and other States,Yes
PAKISTAN,15:31:15,2024-03-07,0:08:00,"Thank you , Chair . Chair , we would like to join others in thanking you and your entire team in preparing all the documents for this meeting and in choosing the manner in which we have conducted ourselves in the course of past four days . And we believe that this methodology that you have chosen has been very helpful in engaging beyond the prepared statements and additional talking points in trying to address where those common points could be for convergence and where the differences are which we should try to bridge going forward on these issues . So very briefly the key take - aways that you have shared with the group before the lunch break , we would welcome the fact that you have provided them in the writing as well giving us an opportunity to share our preliminary comments . We are in agreement with your general observations of where we are in this group . And for us also I think the key take - away , the first key take - away that you have expressed in your remarks that namely prohibitions and regulations that remains the core question for this group . And that would also trigger all the other moving parts as well . It would influence the outcomes in other places under various topics . And it will be closely linked with , for instance , what kind of risk mitigation measures , what kind of other principles would be agreed upon once we have some clarity on prohibitions and regulations taking into account the mandate of this group . Second important key take - away for us that we consider what you have mentioned also , that there has been broad support for dividing our work under various topics , categorizing them in various boxes . We believe that approach would be very helpful going forward . And for us we tend to see all these proposals that are coming under various topics in three distinct boxes . The first one is what are the existing obligations of IHL which are very pertinent to the question of lethal autonomous weapon system which we have been discussing for the last decade , some we have reaffirmed in our past reports and some we would like to reaffirm again in no uncertain terms . Second box , what we see is what are those additional clarification guiding principles or the bridging principles that could give some clarity to the implementation of the existing obligations . As we explained the other day , for instance , in our view , the principles of predictability , reliability , understandability and explainability may not be directly those terms that are contained in the IHL but we believe they are very important for the implementation of the existing obligation principles of IHL . So in this box we would like to delve deeper into what existing tools could be provided to the high contracting parties for implementations of their existing obligations . The third box in our view are the new obligations and commitments that could be undertaken by agreement by the high contracting parties that could form the basis of progressive codification of international law as well which we believe is also one of the main purposes of our convention . We believe that all these three boxes , it is important that when we consider our work and particularly in terms of development of new law we adopt a holistic approach and address all the considerations that have been raised in the past work in an integrated manner . Another take away , Mr. Chair , that you have outlined is that we have heard very clearly in this room in the past four days that there is a lot of work that has been done in the past and that agreed language should continue to form the basis , the foundational basis of our work as we go forward . We believe that all those important agreements whether we have made them with consensus in 2016 or in 2019 or in last year report should constitute without any question as the foundational basis of our work and we would like to see how we can build on them as we go forward . Lastly on the organization of our work and intersessional topics , the questions that you have asked , Mr. Chair , we very much appreciate your proposed methodology . As you have said that there is merit in revisiting topic 1 and 2 while as a few others have pointed out topic 1 May not be the most urgent priority in nature for my Delegation but we do see the merit in providing more granularity to our discussions that have taken place and perhaps narrowing down our convergence . So if that is the spirit in which you would like to revisit topics in intersessional work as well , we would certainly welcome that opportunity . At the same time what we have heard in this room right from the outset of this meeting , a number of state parties have put forward their proposals in terms of new topics going forward that should be considered . For instance , many state parties have put forward the proposal of seven topics that have been shared with the Chair . A few other high contracting parties may have shared their own proposals as well on the topics . We believe there is merit that going forward if you could circulate those proposed topics that you have received from high contracting parties for the information of everyone perhaps in one document and going forward as you seek views on what topics to address in the August meeting , you could invite views from the high contracting parties keeping in view the proposals that have been received so far on these topics . We believe it is an important opportunity and our task should remain , our objective should remain clear that we should have an opportunity to have discussions on all the topics that have been put forward that have been part of our previous discussions in our three - year long GGE process . While we may not be able to arrive at substantive conclusions under every topic , but it is important to exchange in depth the issues that have been raised or will be raised in these topics . So in intersessional period and going forward in August , I think we would need to perhaps follow both the trajectory in terms of revisiting the topics that we have done this far and identifying well in advance for the August meeting so that the Delegates can be prepared in a comprehensive manner to engage more interactively in the August meeting on the questions that may come from your side . I would like to thank you once again , Chair , for providing us this methodology and the approach that you have undertaken . Thank you .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
JAPAN,15:39:40,2024-03-07,0:07:36,"Thank you , Mr. Chairperson . First of all , we would like to thank you for sharing this paper with us . We believe that this paper is very useful in understanding your perspective on the key issues regarding the outcomes of this discussion and this week's discussions and what needs to be done to continue our discussion in future . We are in general agreement with your views on these points . However , I would like to make some preliminary comments . First , I think on your first takeaway , I think this future discussion should be based on prohibition and regulations and also it is related to human control and applications . We do not agree on the use of human control . We have other way of naming this . In general , we agree on your understanding . As for the second takeaway , I think to discuss the compliance issue with IHL from three perspectives which you suggested , the first one is how the weapon is used . The second one is how the context of its use and the third perspective is the capabilities of the weapon itself . I think we are also in support of these notions and I think from these three perspectives , if we could deepen our discussions , I think we could gain more analytical and analytical discussions from which we can expect some advancements on these issues . As for the third takeaway , I think it is very important structure of our work . What we want you to add is we want to structure elements which we are discussing now . Structure elements means structure how the discussion on how we structure our final deliverables , our instruments . These discussions also need to be done . As for the fourth takeaway , that is building upon already agreed language . I think we agree on this and we also proposed this in our in the past discussions . What we would like to add is I think the outcome , I think we will not also use the last year's report , draft report of GGE . I think we had a very good language in that draft report . In particular , such as on the topics such as human machine interaction , accountability , risk mitigation and confidence building measures . I think the languages on those topics in the last year's draft report can also be a good basis for our future discussions . Then as for characterization , I think you are suggesting to continue the discussion on this issue . We have found that there is still divergent views on this topic . I think that means we might need to have more structured way of discussions on this . So I think just continuing the discussion in the same way we did this week might not be further advancement on this discussion . Lastly , this is my question with regard to the way forward . How will the outcomes of the current session be linked to the next session ? It also goes to how we can connect our whole year's discussion to the next year's GGE . I think this is a very important topic and if there is anything you can share at this point , I would like to hear it . Thank you .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
PHILIPPINES,15:47:17,2024-03-07,0:01:07,"I would like to thank the Distinguished Representative of Japan for his intervention . With regard to your question , that is something I would like to hear the views of the rest of the room also and then we will see how we can react to that also in the light of , of course , the discussion we are also going to have tomorrow afternoon still on other matters regarding to the work of the GGE and our mandate .",Asia-Pacific States,Yes
SWITZERLAND,15:48:33,2024-03-07,0:04:27,"Mr. Chair , our Delegation thanks you for facilitating interactive discussions thus far . We generally agree with the key take - aways you articulated at the conclusion of this morning's session . To answer part of the question you posed , although there is value in continuing discussion on characteristics of the organization , we believe that an exact definition of autonomous weapon systems is not required for the elaboration , development and negotiation of any normative and operational framework governing them . A working characterization is enough as a useful starting point to start discussions and move forward , for example , on discussions on prohibitions and regulations . We support views on the need to build upon already agreed language which can be useful as a basis for us going forward . It is important to identify , recognize and further elaborate on these common grounds . Finally , we join others in hoping that discussions on meaningful human control and ethical considerations could be started during the intersessional or in the next session as well . Thank you , Mr. Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
GERMANY,15:53:09,2024-03-07,0:00:37,"Thank you , Mr. Chair . We just wanted to express our support and for the suggestion just made by the colleague from Switzerland . We would also find it very helpful to have something from your part that summarizes your view of our discussions and we , of course , very much support your the comments that you have circulated during lunchtime for the further work . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
BRAZIL,15:54:13,2024-03-07,0:03:23,"Thank you very much , Mr. Chair . Good afternoon , everyone . I would just like to offer a few ideas along with those that have been already expressed , very interesting ideas expressed by colleagues before me . First , I would like to thank you for issuing this nonpaper to help us think about the next steps . I think that we I agree with other colleagues who said that we will benefit greatly from another paper by you , Chair , that summarizes our discussions in the intersessional period and intense work in the intersessional period so that we can make the best use of the limited time we still have until the end of the year . And I think that although the papers , the presentations that were the foundation of our work this week were excellent to stimulate substantive debate , I think there will be merit to restructuring it in a way that will make our contributions more coherent . The proposal made by my colleague from Pakistan I think offers a very sound basis for this endeavor . Like others like Philippines , the Philippines we do believe that investing too much energy in the definitions and characterizations might not be the best way forward given the fact that as Australia has put out so eloquently , there is a difference of understanding as to whether we are defining laws that need to be prohibited or the whole category . So I think that we need to make the obligations and new commitments that we are considering more clear before we venture into that endeavor . Along the lines of the suggestion made by Pakistan , which is to structure our work and in particular the paper that we are asking you to prepare along those three broad categories , I would also like to suggest that we recover language elements from past GGE reports that we could already insert into these categories . This is along the lines of what Frances indicated that we need to separate between what is agreed and what still needs to be agreed . I bring to this discussion the experience of the GGE on ICTs in which there was a choice , for those who are not familiar with this process , there was a choice in the last GGE to structure the work in a way that would build another layer of common understandings so we do not lose what was done in the past . So if we do this , our work will be cumulative and we will not have to restart the same basic understandings at every meeting . It would be a way to frame the situation of our debates and avoid repetition of discussions that we already had in the past . That said , Chair , we are looking forward to your guidance as to the next steps leading to the August session . Thank you very much . Thank you for sharing your views and also a few suggestions for organizing our work and what to be discussed next in a way and how we should discuss it also taking into account remarks made by other Delegations like Pakistan and the Philippines , all very helpful . On the other hand , I see a lot of homework coming in my direction . We will think about that , what we can promise now , what we can do now and what clearly is some work to be done in the intersessional period . This is not something that we can do overnight also in relation to sensitivities around a number of issues . But yes , I agree . We should not reinvent the wheel and I think your idea to build another layer of common understanding , I think that is a very good reflecting in one sentence what I tried to explain in a little bit more words than just this one sentence . Looking around the room , any further requests for the floor ?",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
MEXICO,15:59:23,2024-03-07,0:06:01,"The floor is yours . Thank you very much , Chairman . At the outset , I should like to echo those who spoke before me to congratulate you for the way in which you have been organizing our work . I think this has been reflected in some very substantive discussions , some very rich discussions and we would also like to thank you for this document with your thoughts in it . We think that the methodology that is been used has been very useful . We would simply suggest that for the future that a little more time be given to allow consideration of the questions and to submit responses . Quite often because of consultations taking place between countries or workload , there's not very much time to find the responses and so it makes our life quite difficult . In general terms , we would agree with the thoughts and comments circulated in particular in that prohibitions and regulations are essential going forward but also in the understanding that there is an interrelationship or indeed a link with developments in other arenas . Although we can support the division of this thematic consideration into different sections and here Pakistan's proposal , we think , would be positive , we would nevertheless have the following specifications to make . First of all , with regard to the IHL obligations for autonomous weapons systems , we think this would allow the identification not only of the relevant rules and standards but also to understand the interpretation of these made by various countries or whether other convention and customary laws have been considered by states . We think that from this point of view , that is obligation of IHL . My Delegation welcomes the idea of using this lawfulness approach with regard to these weapons as opposed to their operation . Secondly , once we find common ground in terms of the understanding of IHL , we could then , as Pakistan says , look at identifying what the relevant principles are that would be fundamental when interpreting IHL and which should be undertaken in line with the Convention for Codification and Progressive Development of International Law . As you will see , my Delegation does not think that these are mutually exclusive . We do nevertheless think that it is worth codifying them . We would agree with the idea of having a holistic approach to all the work that is done within the context of this group of experts . As my Delegation sees it , this would include both the previously adopted agreements in the context of the GGE but also for previous working documents as well . If you have a different interpretation of that , then we would welcome hearing that in terms of the submission of documents from previous sessions . Now , some other thoughts on previous work . The agreements that have been made within the context of the Working Group are , of course , an essential foundation in terms of how we can then move our work forward , but we do need to understand that much of this language , because of its consensus - based nature , is by its nature ambiguous and so could lead to diverging interpretations . My Delegation would be open to revisiting Topics 1 and 2 . We think these would be essential in terms of appreciating the nuances of the various topics addressed to date . Of course , that is without prejudging Mexico's position on the topic in terms of characterization and definitions that we have mentioned at this meeting . That would be similar to what was expressed by the Philippines and by Brazil . Now , of course , it would also be important to understand that although we can look at the topics in sections , in blocks for the next discussions that we are going to have in this Forum , at the end of the day , we are going to have to establish or find what the different interactions are between the different sections or blocks , which in part is what is being identified in the discussions in this session . Although discussions are being classified into different sections , there are interactions . There is a relationship between them . These would have to be born in mind and we would have to ensure that those are fully understood if we are to ensure a positive outcome at the end of the GGE's work . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
UNITED STATES,16:05:40,2024-03-07,0:08:56,"Thank you , Chair , for giving us the floor . We wanted to start by reiterating our thanks to you and your team for what has been in our view a really successful week . We have gotten off to a great start . We have in particular really appreciated the interactive dialogue on these many issues . I think the mode of work that you offered us has been essential to allowing us to have that discussion . Like the Swiss Delegation , we also have an overarching sense that we are seeing convergence and overlap in the way that Delegations are thinking about and talking about these issues . That is really important . I think we are all struggling with difficult substantive issues . We are explaining one another's perspectives . I am hearing us coming together in ways and I think that is important . To react to the takeaways in your paper on characterization , I think for our Delegation , we think that this should continue to be a priority for this group . Like the Australian Delegation , I think we do remain concerned that the way the discussion has developed , we are seeing a pretty fundamental difference in the way that Delegations consider the underlying purpose of this characterization discussion and what its relation would be to a possible future instrument . As a very basic proposition , we do need to know what weapons we are talking about before we can really think carefully about a future instrument and how IHL applies and so on and so forth . That is a pretty fundamental issue . At the same time , there has been a really good discussion about the different visions that people have and you are not going to get to the next step without bringing that discussion together with concrete language in front of us , which you did this week . Notwithstanding how much that discussion illustrated this fairly fundamental division , what was interesting to us was that we did actually hear quite a bit of convergence around some of the terminology . I think this is a good illustration of what the Delegation of Switzerland was sort of talking about . We are trying to come together . We are finding ways to narrow our thinking . This is difficult stuff . These are complicated issues . This is , I think , a good illustration both of the continued differences that we see but why the process that we are going through is already bearing important fruit . But with respect to the issues that we have been discussing , I think for our Delegation , characterization is really an important one to keep front and center . On our international humanitarian law discussion , I think here I can really only just 100 % agree with the way the Delegation of Pakistan described maybe the best way to think about how we should be approaching this . The idea that we have sort of three boxes that we need to be thinking about . We need to understand existing IHL and how the contours of existing IHL apply . I think that is a very important exercise . We have been going through that . And I think with respect to the second box again , we would just agree that we should be focused on the bridging principles , the clarifications , what we do to implement those principles . I think that is also very important . We would also agree that there is this third box . Now , we are maybe not in the same place as the Delegation of Pakistan . I think the Delegation of Brazil also sort of agreed with the basic methodology . We are not at a point yet where we necessarily agree that we see the new law that needs to be developed . But I do not know that you can get to a point where you can see that new law until you have addressed the first two boxes . So we actually would like to associate ourselves with the Delegation of Pakistan as maybe this could be a good way to frame our discussions in this area moving forward . With respect to , you know , IHL , obviously we think there is room . IHL is a very large body of law . I think there is room to focus and get more specific and more granular in the context of the first box that was identified . And then with respect to the second box , I think we have already made some pretty good progress , maybe initial progress , but the 2023 report itself I think identifies some of these sort of bridging principles . Again , this is I think partly the way the ICRC was explaining yesterday , a way to identify those principles or measures or actions that are necessary to implement IHL obligations . I think there is room to further elaborate there . With respect to the observations made by some Delegations about building on agreed language , I do think that as the Delegation of Japan and some other Delegations mentioned , this is an important thing to do . It is a way to structure our work , but it is also a way to bring a lot of good previous work back to the forefront in terms of Maybe good starting points for possible future agreed language . And it also illustrates and here , Chair , I am just thinking we have had many late night discussions and debates usually in the context of finalizing a report where we are grappling with these pretty fundamental issues , grappling with the terminology that people prefer . And we have found some good compromises in the past . And so having that language front of mind is a good way to remind ourselves of how we have bridged difficult moments in the past . In terms of topics for the next session and how to handle the intersessional period , we recognize that it is difficult for Delegations to participate in intersessional work . We do have a considerable period of time , though , before the next session . So it seems critical to us to have some sort of plan of work for the intersessional period to keep the positive momentum going and to prepare for a productive second session . I have already mentioned that we think characterization is something that would be worth continuing to focus on . I think we should also continue to focus on IHL . In terms of additional topics , we would like to find time to address accountability and responsibility measures as this does seem like an area where there could be consensus on other important foundational issues . Thank you , Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
AUSTRIA,16:15:08,2024-03-07,0:05:04,"Thank you very much . And I am sorry , I am taking the floor again . I just also wanted to engage in the discussion and also reinforce some points that were excellent and were made by colleagues , in particular our Swiss colleague , but also by others on the way forward . I have said some words already in the morning . We agree to a large part with your characterizations . I think this is a good structured approach . Once again , I think we find it useful to have some more text on the table taking into account also previous working papers . But I think something that was interesting with your approach this week was definitely the kind of alternatives that we could see and different ways of Delegations are thinking at the same time on the same screen . I think this made us realize that there are many convergences more than despite saying it time and time again that there are convergences but seeing them on the screen makes it a little bit easier to actually grasp them . Again , on characterizations and definitions , we do not necessarily need it . It is not a priority but we understand that some Delegations need this kind of traditional approach to set a fence , what we are talking about . So it is okay for us as well . And then we want to agree with the very important point that was made by I think Australia and also the United States that when we are talking about this different boxes or ways or this kind of structuring of our work at least in our minds around IHL issues , it is important for us that we do not only look into a rephrasing or reinforcing of IHL rules that already exist but really how to implement this in a practical way and also it is maybe not exactly the same thing but in our thinking also in ways how in relation to something that has come in this week in ways on how to use weapons systems , how in the way how they are used , those principles can also be implemented and this is something that this kind of active way and not just setting out rules as something without explaining how they can actually take effect , our working paper is taking a more active approach in that regard . And I again invite people to read it despite its late submission . If we do not do this , if we are actually just doing a kind of reaffirmation of existing law , we are also seeing a certain risk . If we do not at the same time explain what are the gaps , how can they be filled and what should we do , we are having a certain risk that we are legitimizing weapons systems but just saying if you do it in line with existing international law , as long as you do it , they are fine . And this is definitely not the case . We have identified too many risks in this group to simply say that or indicate this even by way of result . So it is extremely important that we also look into other possible concerns or possible gaps that we are seeing also and this is quite important for our Delegation that not necessarily only relates to international humanitarian law . And we have pointed in the past to human rights law , something that has also been part of our work in the past and here I also want to reinforce the point that many of the things that we have discussed this week have already been part of the reports of previous GGEs and colleagues have made this point . There is also the issue of international criminal law which must not be dismissed and , of course , there is this big subset of ethical considerations that have followed the mandate of the group for many years where we also have a lot of knowledge , a lot of body of work and also working papers and we might also intend to submit something there for the future . Since and this is also something we acknowledge this kind of additional layer of ethical principles which in many parts is already ingrained within IHL as it exists but also might open up new problems with regards to autonomous weapon systems . We understand that there is kind of a lack of depth of our discussions and I think there is also that we could provide this depth and we might provide something for the consideration of the group to go into that direction even within the intersessional period if you would allow that . Yes , and those are our points . Once again , thank you for this week and we are looking forward to tomorrow , of course , and also the intersessional period .",Western European and other States,Yes
CUBA,16:20:21,2024-03-07,0:02:50,"Thank you very much , Chairman . We should like to thank you for the efforts you have deployed in order to continue to look at the way forward for this session , the intersessional period and the next meeting in August . We also very much appreciate the rich debate that we have had . Structuring our work and including more categories and subdivisions could , we think , assist us in more clearly understanding divergences and convergences . However , we think that we need to bear in mind the relationship between all the relevant topics in our work . With regard to your questions on the characterizations and definitions , Chairman , we do not yet have a definitive response to give you . However , for this topic , as well as for all of the work of the GGE , we should like to echo what was expressed by other Delegations with regard to the importance of maintaining a holistic approach which will allow us to build on international humanitarian law whilst incorporating different perspectives such as ethical perspectives and perspectives from other relevant standardization bodies . We think it is important and necessary to build on the basis of common understandings as agreed , of course , but we think we can go further . We think we can extend that and avoid restricting ourselves to only what is contained in previous reports of the group . If we do not do so , we will be failing to complete our mandate . We should also like to echo what was expressed by Pakistan and reiterate its worth in terms of the organization of our work . We think that for the next session , we should be bearing in mind other topics such as regulations , ethical perspectives , responsibility and accountability amongst others . We understand that there may be divergences on this topic , but we think that nevertheless , there should be a space to discuss this . Looking at the next session , Chair , as the Delegations have said , we think it would be useful to have the documentation necessary that would help our work as soon as possible , as far in advance as is possible . That would feed into a more rich debate and allow for even more interactive participation as Delegations would have a more interdisciplinary instruction in real time from their capitals . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
FINLAND,16:23:48,2024-03-07,0:01:06,"The floor is first to Finland . You have the floor . Thank you , Mr. Chair . In an interactive manner during this productive and constructive week , we have heard that two - tier approach is getting increasing support , even though with different understandings as the representative from Australia outlined it in an excellent way . In this challenging multiparameter problem we have at hand , there is a vast array of variables . The most important ones are the definition of characterization on one axis , in other words , what we are actually talking about , and the threshold that separates Tier 1 and Tier 2 on the other axis . In order to get into the new findings of the convergences , other axis should be fixed or freezed at least temporarily . On later phase , if and hopefully we manage to agree what needs to be regulated , the definition can then be formed serving the purpose . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,16:25:04,2024-03-07,0:23:02,"Thank you , Mr. Chairperson . First and foremost , allow me to thank you for the principles you have adopted in organizing our work , for the fact that Delegations are conducting these discussions in a constructive manner and in general the fact that you are holding results oriented discussions . We can only welcome this . Distinguished Chair , thank you very much as well for the fact that you have shared with us your thesis and you did so before lunch which allowed us then to prepare in a much better way for the discussions of the important questions relating to the continuation of the work of the group to ensure some follow - up to these activities in the most effective way possible and the most interactive and constructive way possible . On the substantive points that were identified by you , in general we share your evaluation , your assessments that you have made and we agree with the structure of the results achieved by us during the first session as identified by a user . We consider the first thesis put forward by you in the context of the need to work on a definition of these kinds of weapon systems and developing a definition is indeed critical and a really important part of our work which has been clearly demonstrated during the discussions that we have held in the context of this first session . These discussions clearly demonstrated that different Delegations are living in different Universes . Some Delegations are living in a Universe of a two - tier approach . Other Delegations are living in other Universes but even those Delegations who are living in the so - called two - tier approach Universe as we have seen have a different understanding of the functioning of this Universe and the principles it is based on . We consider it absolutely vital at this point in time to take the necessary measures to make sure that we do not avoid seizing this moment and we do not allow the discussions to go off on different parallel tracks linked to different understandings of the subject matter of what we are discussing . This could lead to a highly negative impact on the work of the group in particular given the mandate that we must fulfill . We also wish to underscore once again during this session that we very much count on the fact that Delegations who are so actively speaking to the fact that it is not expedient to work on the definition will then adopt the same logical approach on other initiatives which are being discussed in parallel in parallel forum related to arms control where exactly the same Delegations are proponents of the absolute contrary logic . That is they declare that a definition and developing and deciding on a definition is a fundamental requirement , fundamental element of any legally binding agreement and I am quoting them here in the arms control sphere . In particular if we are speaking of weapons . We believe that this demonstrates double standards and we consider that we need to seek consistency in a logical approach in discussing all arms control issues irrespective of whether we are dealing with new spheres such as lethal autonomous weapons systems or any other spheres . Specifically on the definition distinguished Chair , we consider that alongside human control which has been identified by you , we also need to discuss as well two other groups of questions or clusters which are key ones to have a definition of this kind of weapon system . The first group or cluster are discussions of concrete or specific categories of systems , weapons systems which would fall under a definition of lethal autonomous weapons systems . That is vital to do , again , for the reason that we have a different understanding of those categories which could be considered to be autonomous weapons systems as a whole and in particular lethal autonomous weapons systems . The second category or cluster of questions is the need to discuss specific tasks that such systems , weapons systems might be able to fulfill . We have heard a very broad spectrum of opinions amongst Delegations and it is our view that this requires further discussion from our side . Once again , we would underscore that in application to these questions we need to discuss as well the systems which are for military purposes and dual use systems as well . Systems aimed to fulfill specific military tasks and also systems which also fulfill other tasks , supporting functions . Then the third cluster of questions that you have identified , of course , the issues of the autonomous nature and the human control and I think that this group of questions is one which has been worked on in quite a great deal of detail not only during this session but during previous sessions of the group as well . We have had a sufficiently focused approach to looking at human control and the autonomous nature of these weapons and we believe that we are quite close to having an understanding which would be mutually acceptable for all Delegations . Then on your second thesis , Distinguished Chairperson , we consider this to be shedding light on the application of existing norms and principles of international humanitarian law as all three bullet points here that you have identified all concern exactly the application of existing norms of international humanitarian law . We share this logical approach . We think it is fully justified particularly when it is closely linked to definition as once we have a definition , then we will see how we consider the issues of the application of existing norms of international humanitarian law and international law in general to such weapons systems . However , once again without a definition , moving to examine those questions would be much more complicated and those discussions would therefore be more theoretical in nature . Then on the application of existing norms of international humanitarian law , these discussions on these questions are really important indeed to our group of governmental experts as we seek to fulfill our mandate . Without an analysis of the application of existing norms and principles of international humanitarian law to these weapons systems , it would not be possible to identify the need to develop any additional understandings for these weapons systems , especially if there is talk of developing any kind of potential instrument of a legal nature . It is only once we have had an analysis of the sufficiency of the existing norms and principles of IHL and the relation to the specific characteristics of lethal autonomous weapons systems that we could then answer all of those questions . We cannot do this the other way around . That will not be successful . Indeed in the context of such an analysis , we have looked at the bullet points that you submitted . In particular with regard to the first bullet point , we have looked at this in the context of the application of existing norms and principles of IHL relating to matters relating to the way in which we operate with , relate to these weapons . So how they can be applied in practice and that in line with the norms and principles of IHL . The second bullet we believe is part of the first bullet . So subsidiary 2 . As the issue of defining the context to great deal is to great extent is linked to those measures to mitigate risk in the application of and use of this kind of weapon system . We discussed this during this session and we do not object to a continuation of these discussions . However , we do consider that to have this discussion separately in parallel with questions relating to the application of laws is not really the best approach . We think that these are interrelated questions and one is a key issue and the other is subsidiary to it . Then the third bullet concerns issues of developing and drafting and the life cycle , so working development on the development of weapons and other parts of the life cycle of these kinds of weapons and their deployment and their use . Here , this question is to great extent linked to the conduct of a legal analysis and legal review . So legal review and other measures which could minimize risk , mitigate risk during the development and design and use of these systems . Turning to the third and fourth theses , I will not comment on these at this point because we completely agree with the considerations put forward by you , Chair . Alongside what you have mentioned here , Distinguished Chair , we consider it very important indeed to conduct work on incorporation of the compilation that we have discussed of already agreed understandings and language worked on here in the GGE . First and foremost , this concerns the guiding principles and different conclusions that the group has come to as of 2018 . It is very important as well in this to conduct some creative work on the understandings and formulations that have been discussed in the group of governmental experts but which unfortunately were not adopted in previous years , though they were to a great extent agreed upon or were almost agreed upon , in practice agreed upon . We also have that substantive work . We believe that it would be very good indeed to use this and we should not lose an opportunity to do so . Too much time and effort has been deployed by us on this work for us not to really take full advantage of it . Moreover , it is our view that we should also look through the different issues to look at the issues which could not be agreed upon by consensus in the group . Discussions during this session will help you in this and I believe that it is not that difficult to identify such issues and to have a first look through , a first filtering of those issues that we have discussed to see then what we should focus on so we can focus on those subjects where we might achieve a consensus approval in this group . This would also allow us to focus in on specific questions and clusters of issues which could then be discussed in the group . Many categories of issues are highly complex , highly complicated . They require serious efforts and a great deal of time spent on them . We do not want to come up against a situation where at some point in time we would have a lack of time available to discuss those matters where we could indeed achieve a consensus and as happened previously we do not then agree on what we would be fully capable of agreeing on . Distinguished Chair , during future discussions we believe it to be of key importance to keep in mind the mandate of the group as a holistic mandate and not anticipating the results of the activities of the group and not trying to change or rewrite this mandate so that we would not then waste time on repeating discussions on this mandate given different interpretations that Delegations may have . We believe as has been said many times by you , Chair , during this session it is important that we focus on the substance and we put to one side issues of the format or the form and postpone those thoughts and discussions to the future , especially as the lack of an understanding on particular issues including the issue of the definition does not allow us to come up with clear decisions as to what form or format would be the optimal one , the most expedient one for us to have as a substantive outcome to present the understandings . Then one last point that I wished to make at this point . Distinguished Chair , we would be highly interested in receiving in good time any additional material and considerations which might be drafted by you and your team in the context of the second session of the group as given the very specific nature of the questions that we discuss here our Delegation as I think many other Delegations as well requires sufficient time in order to develop specific points and positions with interdepartmental work domestically given the very complex nature of these issues and the need to work with a large number of experts and agencies and ministries in this process . To make sure that we can make the maximum amount of constructive input into the work of the group we do require sufficient time to do our homework at home to prepare for the next session of the group of governmental experts . So we would prefer to have the new considerations from your new papers from you at least a month before the next session , please , so that we could work on them at home , so we could work on them in the capital and prepare for the next session . Thank you very much .",Eastern European States,Yes
UNITED KINGDOM,16:49:17,2024-03-07,0:05:10,"Thank you , Mr. Chair and thank you for providing us with your remarks . The UK agrees that the discussions that we have had so far this week have prepared the ground for further progress with regard to fulfilling our mandate and the UK would like to thank you and your team and all of the states who have engaged constructively and informatively this week . We also agree with the sentiments heard this afternoon and we are pleased to see a pathway through this mandate on the basis of the work we have done and the work ahead . Now , turning to the specific suggestions for moving our discussions forward , with reference to subsection 1 , Mr. Chair , the UK respectfully does not agree with the proposition that a description of lethal autonomous weapons systems should be written on the basis of the regulatory measures . That is to say that characterization is not intrinsically linked to an assumption of a certain type of regulatory measure for weapons in that category . Australia has been perceptive in noting that the approach to the discussion on a common understanding on laws has been approached differently by different Delegations . To the extent that the description of the subject matter of this discussion was immediately linked to specific measures or value judgments as to the nature of the subject matter , then that description will immediately become problematic . This group could usefully delineate the subject matter they were speaking about before seeking to identify the characteristics of certain types of these systems which fit the categories as shown in subsection 2 of your comments . The concept of the two - tier approach is one that has been referred to a lot during this week and it would appear to the UK Delegation that there is widespread acceptance and acknowledgement that this is the preferred way forward . The problem with basing our description upon a basis that assumes that certain systems are inherently prohibited is that it moves the definitional problem . If the argument is that laws which do not have human control are inherently incompatible with IHL , the question would be how do you define human control in that context ? Does it have to be immediate control or control over the circumstances of deployment or control over effect ? We have had a rich number of interventions on these matters this week , but there has been a circular element to the approach when addressing these concepts in relation to the characterization . Turning to subsection 2 , Mr. Chair , you have stated that this group needs to consider the issue of compliance with IHL and how a weapon is used , the context of its use and the capabilities of the weapon itself . The UK would agree that these categories are pertinent to conceptualizing laws . As mentioned previously , there are certain types of weapon that are per se prohibited under disarmament law and others that on the basis of their characteristics would be prohibited under IHL . For example , indiscriminate weapons or those that are inhumane or cause unnecessary suffering . Such weapons can be clearly categorized as being contrary to international law . Questions of context and how a weapon is used are clearly matters where there are great variables . The potential to develop positions which naturally lead to either a conclusion of prohibition or necessary regulation in relation to these issues of how a system supports or otherwise the performance of IHL is clear . However , that exercise needs to be separated from the more straightforward exercise of those systems which are intrinsically incompatible . Moving on to subsections 3 and 4 , the UK agrees that it would be best to systematically divide up topics and we would suggest starting with previous points of agreement and the more straightforward of the principles such as intrinsic qualities to agree on and providing previous consensus and near consensus to narrow down the points of difficulty . We also agree with Delegations who have noted that intercessional work could usefully be used to strengthen consensus points and perhaps reflect on some of the points on terminology and areas where we are using terminology differently and underpinning it with different objectives and presumptions . Finally , Mr. Chair , the UK has found the discussions this week to be very helpful in understanding the positions across the room . This will offer us all an opportunity to consider the various objectives that we have heard with a view to ensuring that they might be reflected in the measures that we are mandated to discuss . Thank you , Mr. Chair .",Western European and other States,Yes
EL SALVADOR,16:54:49,2024-03-07,0:01:53,"Thank you very much , Chairman . First of all , we should like to congratulate you for the way in which you have been leading this work in this session of the GGE . My Delegation thinks that the discussions have been constructive and well - organized and so we would like to take this opportunity also to welcome the contributions of all Delegations in other countries as well as from civil society on this topic . With regard to the topics to be addressed , El Salvador is one of the countries that supports the Joint Statement made by Pakistan on this aspect and also as part of the G15 , we sent a textual proposal in terms of the topics that should be addressed within the GGE . My Delegation , therefore , agrees on many aspects with what was expressed by Pakistan on their intervention on this item . We think that it is essential to maintain a holistic approach and focus on the elements that are relevant for each and every one of the Delegations whilst looking to make constructive progress in the compliance with our mandate . My Delegation also thinks that undertaking an approach that goes beyond humanitarian law would be useful and alongside Australia and Cuba and other Delegations , we think it would be relevant and timely to take into account other international standards as well as ethical issues as well . Finally , we should like to welcome the submission of the relevant documentation and we would like to we would welcome the submission of the documents sufficiently in advance and we would also like to be able to address these issues according to the schedule as was mentioned by yourself . Thank you .",Latin American and Caribbean States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,17:11:19,2024-03-07,0:07:26,"Thank you , Distinguished Chair . Thank you for those explanations that you have given . We are also grateful for the fact that again we have come back to the questions that we discussed so we can look at them with fresh eyes on the basis of the discussions we have held based on the exchange of views that we have conducted . So we can now endeavor to identify the main points to allow us to further discuss these questions so that we can simplify convergence . We believe that those questions that you just put to us are completely justified . Turning to the last question , we consider this question in the context of identifying the tasks that specific weapon systems would undertake in the context of the lethal autonomous weapon systems category . So identifying those tasks that should correspond to the definition of lethal autonomous weapon systems . It is our view that attempts to say that working on a definition is to be linked to possible prohibitions or restrictions on such weapon systems on the basis of specific functions is not completely justified . If we are talking about definitions of weapon systems based on new technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapon systems , then we should be speaking of all the functions that these systems carry out to conduct military or supporting tasks as in theoretical terms we allow for the fact that in the future there might be weapon systems which might act autonomously to fulfill any of their functions . Not only functions to identify , select and engage . If we wish to define a category of weapons , especially if we are speaking of a category of autonomous weapons , then we believe that we can only speak strictly of weapons systems whose functions are autonomous . So fully autonomous without any operator involvement . Moreover , the second question , moving on to the second question , what functions we consider require restrictions or prohibition ? This is a completely different question for a completely different discussion . But if we define the concept as the one that we attempted to outline , any attempts to restrict the definition to reduce it just to autonomous nature of two or three or whatever quantity of functions would lead our discussions to discussing non-autonomous weapon systems but to discussing weapon systems with different degrees of autonomy . But that is a different category . That is a category where some functions are autonomous and other functions have operator involvement . And to call such systems autonomous systems is not correct . Those systems have some degree of autonomy and some functions are for the human to carry out and some are autonomous . They are two different categories . And they can be considered in different ways . And the assessment of the functioning of the weapon systems application and development will be assessed in a different way . There's different risks involved in the different systems . And it is very important to specify exactly what we are talking about . From our side we would underscore once again that we understand autonomous weapon systems including lethal autonomous weapon systems to be those weapon systems which are intended , are designed to carry out any military activities or any supporting functions in a completely autonomous manner so that is without any operator involvement . All other categories of weapon systems where there is some degree of optimization or autonomous functions of some kind are automated systems . Thank you .",Eastern European States,Yes
AUSTRIA,17:33:28,2024-03-07,0:03:12,"Thank you . Again , very sorry to be a late time speaker , but I think I want to use this time that we are still having available to discuss the issue of the autonomy as it was raised by the Russian Federation when we talk about definitions . I think one issue that we have to consider when we talk about definitions and characterizations is that it should be a definition that works for everyone and not just for one Delegation . There is a specific problem when we take this notion that autonomy is absolute and that autonomy would mean that there is absolutely no human control . The problem , and this has been confirmed by many Delegations , it has been widely discussed in the past , but also this week , is that a fully autonomous weapon system first by this very nature creates problems with the implementation of IHL . Many of them , I cannot cite them all , accountability , responsibility , controllability , it is a large number and per se should be prohibited under IHL . The second problem is that it is probably also not desirable to have a weapon that is out of control of the military that uses it . There are , of course , some specificities and maybe we lack a little bit of detail how such a fully autonomous weapon systems would work and what would be the aim or what would be the context in which it would be used . But if we take this as a generally or broad definition that we should use , it does not make it just does not sound like weapon systems that most militaries would want to use . This leads us also to the problem that if we come to this conclusion , if our definition is that laws are those absolutely autonomous systems and they per se would be prohibited under IHL , then the result of ten years of discussions would be that laws are prohibited . And I do not think that this is the outcome that we could agree and also not the outcome that is desirable . We should have a little bit more delicacy and a little bit more detail . Thank you . Maybe but we will come back to that on Monday on the idea of negative Friday . Sorry . I could go on for three weeks on Friday is the positive and negative obligations question . Our position is maybe a little bit complicated in that regard that we are very much an advocate for positive obligations when it comes to human control . But in our view , they are also part of the prohibition . So they are negative obligations at the same time . So it is black and white . It is quite diverse . It is positive and negative , how we see it . Thank you .",Western European and other States,Yes
RUSSIAN FEDERATION,17:37:22,2024-03-07,0:06:46,"Thank you , Distinguished Chair . We would like to react to what has been said by our Distinguished Colleague from Austria . Firstly , we very much hope that on Monday we will be back in Moscow . Secondly , Distinguished Chair , we are delighted that finally we have started a discussion that would allow us to really understand exactly why we are here and what specifically we are discussing . Because when we hear beautiful words and expressions about a two - tier approach , about fully autonomous systems , semi or partially autonomous systems , and meaningful human control or human control in principle , we all understand that in our own way and what has been discussed up until now has shown to us that everybody understands it in their own way . Once again , I would repeat , our example does not live in the universe of a two - tier approach . We are trying to understand exactly what categories we could talk about . And in relating to each of these categories , what exactly this group of governmental experts could do in order for us to fulfill our mandate . If we are talking about a definition of this category of weapons , then for us it is really quite evident that if we are talking about lethal autonomous weapons systems , then in one way or another we are going to have to discuss the kinds of weapons whose functions are fully carried out without any kind of human operators' involvement at all . We are not prepared to speculate about a definition of human control or a two - tier approach or anything else . We wish to really identify an understanding of exactly the category that we are going to discuss . We need to start with that . And every time we are trying to leap forward , leap over this and talk about prohibitions and restrictions . But let's start with an understanding of exactly what we are looking to discuss here in this group . The mandate provides for a discussion on weapons systems based on new emerging technologies in the sphere of lethal autonomous weapons systems . Let's understand exactly what we see this to be for us . It is absolutely clear . It is absolutely evident and I would repeat this again , that specific category of autonomous system where all functions are carried out without any human operator involvement at all and another category is automated systems where just some individual functions are carried out autonomously but other functions are carried out with operator involvement . If we are talking about the first category , then those weapons do not yet exist . If we are talking about the second category , then there are different subcategories within this category with different degrees of automation concerning different functions and that can be military systems and also dual purpose systems irrespective of whether they are military or dual use purpose systems , they can be lethal , have lethal properties . They can have very different physical principles of functioning , genetic , non-kinetic properties . If we are talking in the context of international humanitarian law about lethality , that can be linked to harm caused or damage caused to infrastructure , infrastructure which might then have lethal consequences . There are many different aspects if we look at the second category and this all requires discussion . Even if we take three functions which have been identified by several Delegations , so our appeal should be understood in the correct manner . We are not trying to say that we are not prepared to discuss any issues which Delegations would like us to discuss . We are open to this , but we would like clarity so that we can make sure we had the right level of discussions and we can come to the expected results . For this , first and foremost , we need to understand exactly what we are discussing and we are delighted that finally we are moving to do so . Let's define this . Thank you .",Eastern European States,Yes
