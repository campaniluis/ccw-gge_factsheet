# CCW-GGE Factsheet

## Description

This project aims to highlight global discrepancies in the multilateral negotations towards a legally binding instrument on autonomous weapons through the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons' Group of Governmental Experts (CCW/GGE) on LAWS. 

It generates various data analyses related to the CCW/GGE. It includes Python and R scripts to process and visualize data on civil society participation, regional distribution, and other relevant statistics.

What if we could build more tools to analyse multilateral negotiations on top of this? Contribute in this repository or reach out for future projects.
